		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One spin of astronomical luck made Ellen a shoe-in for citizenship, she believed.  But serendipity, even when issued by the American government, is no better than a fortune cookie - a fragile, paper-thin promise at best.

Ellen’s morning of May 13 felt like being stood-up at the altar.  A fateful U-turn in her immigration status ended a cruel game of hide-and-go-seek with the US Department of State.  Ellen and 22,000 other hopeful immigrants, after winning the Diversity Visa Lottery, approximated the potential for American lives dangling within reach.

But those vivid impressions of green cards were suddenly tugged away when the government revoked its own lottery results.  An inadvertent agency blunder sent tens of thousands of new arrivals into immigration exile.

May 1 had brought the American dream tantalizingly closer. Ellen awoke from a fitful, frazzled sleep after months of anticipation, and beamed her bloodshot eyes at a computer screen.  There, on the Department of State’s website, was an official government letter with an agency seal at its crest, naming her as a winner of the 2012 Diversity Visa Lottery.

Overwhelming elation sprung from improbable luck, and a blitzkrieg of emotion flowed over Ellen, drawn from the near-assurance of a green card.

After winning, she phoned 5,000 miles away to a rural farmhouse in Missouri, sitting on three acres of hay fields and wooded terrain.  That is where Jean lives, Ellen’s same-sex American partner.  For three years they’ve lived in separate hemispheres, united exclusively online, Ellen in Eastern Europe and Jean in her A-frame, alfalfa-country farmhouse.

They’ve maintained a loving, long-distance intimacy through all-night Skype sessions and the sharing of Youtube selections.  They’ve even wed, unofficial, over the web.  With Jean dressed by daylight, and Ellen enveloped in nighttime, they slipped rings onto their own fingers in an overseas exchange of vows, a symbolic placeholder until an official ceremony could take place once Ellen immigrated to the US.

The lottery awakened Ellen’s imagination for long-deferred wedding plans ¾ a modest ceremony in scenic Iowa, the sole outlying enclave permitting same-sex marriage within the tradition-oriented Grain Belt, and conveniently close to Jean. “Something very plain, not official, nothing that makes you feel obliged to be in a certain attire,” Ellen fantasized.

Jean’s property is a sheltered paradise of persimmon and apple trees, sunken with snow in the winter, and buzzing with locusts in summer.  “I wish I could sit at that table with her, in all that quiet, with all that wind and leaves whispering and chimes ringing, just holding her hand,” Ellen said, speaking by phone from Eastern Europe.  She requested not to disclose her country of origin or real last name for this article because she holds out slender hopes of obtaining a green card in the future, and fears being blacklisted from the immigration system, or facing backlash for her sexual orientation, if named.

After receiving word from the State Department, Ellen left a gasping, hyperventilating message on May 1, a joyous voicemail that is still fossilized on Jean’s machine. “It's too painful to listen to it now,” she says.

A roller-coaster dive ensued on May 13 with an announcement from the Kentucky Consular Center, the branch of the Department of State responsible for the lottery.  A “computer error,” had affected the randomization process of this year’s running, giving early-applicants like Ellen an unexpected advantage in the mathematical algorithm.  It went unchecked while applications rolled in, as the ping-pong balls bounced, and 22,000 would-be winners were notified of their selections.

“I can not begin to express how much pain, sorrow, angst, and even anger I have experienced as a result of this error,” Jean says.  “It doesn’t seem right that any number of people would be told they were winners, only to find out it was a joke.”

Laughed-off or ignored, the Diversity Visa lottery is an obscure, mostly-invisible corner of US immigration, but an avenue nonetheless, allowing 55,000 green cards per year.  Despite its poverty of slots to give, the program draws millions of foreigners, creating a modern day logjam akin to Ellis Island of old, but transpires online.

This improbable crapshoot was Ellen’s best chance for rejoining Jean.  And like an out-of-nowhere racehorse surprising the field, she was plucked from 19 million applicants to win a coveted spot in the winner’s circle, and stood inches away from a permanent visa - momentarily, for twelve days.

Jean and Ellen continue to live apart, in idleness. “My life is very stressful here,” Ellen says, breaking into tears when describing her prolonged isolation in the former Soviet Union. “But no matter the hardships that I’d have to endure in the US, it would be nothing compared to this, because I would have her near me.”

&nbsp;

<strong>Fairness or Fiasco? </strong>

“These poor buggers who got the letter?  Suck it up and get over it, as far as I’m concerned,” Carl Krueger says, an immigration attorney based in Providence, Rhode Island.  “I hope you didn’t pack your bags, and sell your house, and quit your job, just because you got that letter.”

Of the approximately one million green cards issued in the US each year, the Diversity Visa lottery produces a mere 55,000, with the rest given to asylum-seekers and family members of current citizens. “It’s a drop in the bucket,” Krueger says, who works for the International Institute of Rhode Island, a 90-year-old non-profit, non-government agency, and the largest provider of immigration services in the state.

Most Diversity Visa applicants hail from abroad, but Krueger hears a gamut of inquiries during consultations with illegal and temporary immigrants here.  Krueger, a three-decade veteran of immigration law, was frank and non-partisan in his analysis of the 2012 lottery.  “Even if you’re selected, you haven’t won anything. You’re only on to step two.”

100,000 winners reach that plateau (what began on May 1 for this year’s contest), then are ranked by the Department of State to determine what order they will proceed with government screening.  A trifecta of requirements slims the field incrementally, from 100,000 to 55,000 over the course of twelve months, by weeding out anyone who fails to satisfy any of the pillars: English literacy, an advanced education level (typically 12 years of schooling or a high school equivalency), and two-years of work experience in a skilled trade.

Such stringent requirements are not asked of non-lottery immigrants, who are not even required to speak English as long as they have a family connection.  Krueger acknowledges that bureaucratic inconsistencies like these, diminish the level of equality within the American immigration system, but he finds no fault with the State Department’s decision to schedule a re-draw with this year’s results.

Fairness, for Krueger, was sacrificed once the lottery’s randomization was found inept, and rescinding the visas became the lesser of two evils despite an embarrassing agency mistake.  “They didn’t do the selection the way they were supposed to do it.  But millions more people would have gotten screwed, compared to thousands who are aggrieved.”

However, for 2012 selectees who had a particularly low number in the second stage of screening, a green card was all but assured. Such was the case for Ellen.

“Maybe I should be more sympathetic,” Krueger laughs. “We’re still scratching our heads at how this fiasco unfolded.”

&nbsp;

<strong>Tears of Protest</strong>

“Most U.S. people think we are illegals, or cheap labor.  Or stupid or something,” Anny Gunya says, an online organizer for the ex-winners, speaking by phone from Moscow in fluent English, hardly exhibiting her native Georgian accent.

“For me, America was always the country for liberty.  Where justice always prevailed…But it was all just good P.R.”

Gunya graduated from Moscow University with a degree in marketing last year, and harmonized about the Diversity Visa lottery as a launching pad for an advertising career in New York.  Like a gift-wrapped trampoline, she received an impeccably low lottery number on May 1, then proceeded to quit her job, research the TOEFL exams, and prepare to apply for graduate school in the states.

Heart-set on immigrating, Gunya turned down an enticing job offer from an American beer company’s Russian subsidiary, which dangled a luxury signing bonus in front of her - an all-expense vacation to Manhattan.  But Gunya sought New York as a permanent destination, and closed her lips to short-term corporate cherries.

Sweet dreams turned suddenly sour on May 13.  “I didn’t want to cry, I was just so shocked that I couldn’t speak.”

Over the next two months, Gunya assembled an online artillery to refute the State Department’s broken promises.  She maintained a twitter account - 22,000 Hopefuls, @GreenCard2012 - and monitored a Facebook group - 22,000 Tears - dedicated full time to publicizing their misfortune and advocating for reparations.

Eventually, the ex-winners drew the interest of Kenneth White, an immigration lawyer who agreed to argue their case in court.  36 signed as plaintiffs to sue the Department of State in Federal District Court in Washington. But after hearing arguments, on July 14th, federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed their appeal, arguing along the lines of Krueger’s rationale, stating in her opinion that because the lottery “did not comply with the law,” voiding the results was the only logical option.  Otherwise, Judge Jackson stated, “the Court in all likelihood would now be facing a similar argument of the other 19 million…”.

The judge’s decision, coupled with a re-drawing on July 15, effectively expunged the claims of the original winners, almost none of which who were re-selected, including Ellen.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if things like these would be happening in a third world country,” Ellen says.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Wedding Chimes</strong>

A slew of obstacles await Ellen if she is to salvage any chance of obtaining a green card, and rejoining Jean.  Vivid memories of Missourian plains still occupy her day-to-day thoughts, sticking stubbornly to her mind like peanut butter, though the possibility of a picturesque wedding has begun to melt away.

Across the street from her apartment in Europe, lies a Christian Orthodox Church, housed in Roman architecture.  A commotion erupts there each weekend:  the cobblestone cul de sac clutters with bridesmaids, caravans of cars honk in celebration, and crowds of relatives sing a wedding chorus which torments Ellen’s ears.  The merriment is a repetitive soundtrack to a distant dream, now squandered, of Ellen at an American altar, beside Jean.

A perfect, three-pronged storm - pre-existing legislation, the lottery fiasco, and an impending bill in Congress, has drowned Ellen’s ability to immigrate.

Before the 2012 lottery, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), limited her avenues.  Among other controversial caveats, the law prevents same-sex, bi-national couples from pursuing family re-unification green cards, leaving her no direct route to citizenship, and only a piecemeal of temporary, insufficient alternatives.

“If I apply for an asylum visa, that means I will never be able to come back and see my family,” Ellen says, which would restrict her from returning to Europe, where she cares for two diabetic parents.

And after her winning ticket was revoked, Ellen’s odds constricted further.  Believing that she’d won, she sent in documentation and a $1,000 check to the Department of State, showing “immigration intent,” which jeopardizes her opportunity to apply for a student, worker, or temporary visa in the future.

Now, a bill that just cleared the House Judiciary Committee, if enacted into law, will push Ellen’s immigration status from endangered to extinct.  H.R. 704, or the Security and Fairness Enhancement Act (SAFE), would abolish the Diversity Visa lottery permanently, shutting off any future opportunity for Ellen, or any of the 2012 lottery winners, to roll the dice again.

“Basing our immigration system on the luck of the draw is not smart immigration policy.  It’s an open invitation for fraud and a jackpot for terrorists,“ Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R.-Texas, said during a hearing on the bill, who has tried to encompass the lottery within broader anti-immigration rhetoric, intentionally confusing it with illegal immigration concerns.

But while Republican politicians - 22 of the 39 co-sponsors of the bill are conservatives from the immigration hotbeds of CA, TX, VA, NC, and FL - are using the Diversity Lottery to score political points, their argument relies on bias more than reality.

“It’s a publicity stunt and utter bull-shit,” Krueger says, who dismisses the bill as political grandstanding by lawmakers attempting to invigorate border-state constituencies.  “Seventy-five percent (of legal immigrants) coming into the US, are from 12 countries,” Krueger explains, professing the importance of the Diversity Visa lottery to balance out the immigrant population.

But the US government’s antiquated definition of partnership disregards Ellen and Jean.  “I love my wife, and I don’t think it is anyone right, through law or regulations, who I have a right to love.  I’m not letting any politician do that.  I love who I love.”

After reckoning with the agency’s abrupt about-face, Ellen got a package from Jean on May 14, postmarked a day after the winning announcement, an outdated congratulations intended to be a pre-welcome to America.  “When I opened it, there were keys to our home (in Missouri). Needless to say, I couldn’t stop crying.”

“The immigration system is broken in the US.  There are thousand of illegals, and we wanted to do it legally,” Ellen says.  22,000 Diversity Visa winners placed trust in the government’s word, built blueprints to American lives, then saw them shattered like sandcastles.

Any form of reparation for the ex-winners appears unlikely, but Ellen reels at her lost faith in the US government, feeling forever severed. “Just a month ago, they executed a Mexican citizen.  Why would they care for us?”

Last week, the <em>New York Observer</em>, frequent parodists of the "<a href="http://www.observer.com/2011/08/bernanke-abandoned-threes-a-trend-after-international-economic-adviser-sheets-steps-down-18-year-run-with-fed/">three's</a> <a href="http://www.observer.com/2011/08/news-goes-nuts-testicle-trials-run-rampant-in-american-courtrooms/">a</a> <a href="http://www.observer.com/2006/08/itimei-marches-back-forget-inewsweeki-get-ithe-economisti/">trend</a>" method of reporting, <a href="http://www.observer.com/2011/08/meet-the-mollys-social-network-sweeties-tumbl-upwards-2/">applied the device</a> with unusual aplomb to transform three lady-bloggers-made-good into spokeswomen for a generation of "Mollys." The piece boils down to a gendered version of <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/01/the_making_of_a_trend_piece_an_1.html">"something whimsical about how bloggers are now seamlessly moving into old-media staff jobs"</a>, but more relevant to us is the un-noted fact that two of the three titular Mollys are alumnae of the <em>Independent</em>.

week ago, NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna pepper sprayed 23 year old Jeanne Mansfield and two other women in the face in a now notorious incident in the unfolding story of Occupy Wall Street.  Videos of the macing have gone viral, and Mansfield and her companions are suing the NYPD.
Mansfield had not intended to write about Occupy Wall Street.  A recent graduate of Boston University, she had been following the movement on the Internet for a few weeks prior to visiting New York.  She said that she had decided to stop by because the participants were saying things “that I had been thinking about the banks, about the politics, about the media.”  When she relayed her experience to her editors at the Boton Review, they insisted that she write an op-ed.
Occupy Wall Street is a grassroots populist campaign that has relied heavily on publicity generated by Facebook and Twitter.  It began three weeks ago when a small group camped around Wall Street to protest the role of financial institutions in the economic crisis, unemployment, and corporate lobbying.  It has since spread to the Los Angeles City Hall, downtown Boston, and outside the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago.  The idea, according to its website, was to camp out for weeks or months to replicate the Arab Spring protests.
On the group’s website, they describe themselves as a “leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent.”
The unspoken one percent refers to corporations, banks, and the insurance and mortgage industries.  The 99 percent refers to everyone else.
The demands of the movement are difficult to pinpoint, and—though this may change as protests spread to cities as disparate as Memphis, Baltimore, and Hilo, Hawaii—its imprecision has made it vulnerable to characterization as a shallow imitation of the civil rights and anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s. Also, as with many post-Reagan left-wing protests, Occupy Wall Street has been leveled with charges of hypocrisy (Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for the New York Times, wryly noted protesters  using a Bank of America ATM).
However, the movement has clearly tapped a vein of disgust with the current state of political affairs, and has brought together seasoned civil rights advocates, crusaders against capitalism, and young people frustrated by steep student debt and lack of job prospects.  It remains to be seen whether Occupy Wall Street—a movement that rejects leadership—will have staying power.
After being pepper sprayed, Mansfield insisted, “I love cops… but the experience only makes me wish I’d done something more to deserve it.”

Independent: Could you provide a brief summary of what happened when you went to protest at Occupy Wall Street?

Jeanne Mansfield: So we went down intending to find the occupiers in tents, or maybe playing guitars and making anti-corporate signs, but we didn't even make it to Wall Street because we joined the march in progress. It was about 500 people I'd say, though hard to estimate as we were toward the back of the group and couldn't quite see the front.  We reached Union Square and [then] we set off again back to Wall Street. At this point the police presence intensified and became aggressive as they unreeled the orange crowd-control netting and began scuttling us into side streets. The cops began making violent arrests in the street, incensing the crowd contained on the sidewalk. After a minute or so of loud shouting from the crowd the cops grabbed kids out of the group to arrest.  One police officer in white strode up to the front and maced three girls [including myself] directly in the face.

Indy: Are you going to press charges?

JM: The girls who were maced directly in the face are suing the city of New York for violation of civil rights. I'm in contact with their lawyer and have decided to join their suit, both to help their cause and try to bring about some sort of policy changes within the NYPD.

Indy: Do you see yourself or the other two becoming figureheads for the movement?

JM: I definitely would not see myself as becoming a figurehead, and I haven't heard much else from the girls themselves. I think the great thing about the movement is that it doesn't need figureheads, it's surviving and thriving on the lips and in the minds of every American citizen who sees what we see: a wealth and influence disparity that is subverting the democratic process. I think as the days and weeks wear on, we will be seeing more and more people coming out in solidarity with the movement.

Indy: Do you plan on continuing your activist work?

JM: Yes. Definitely. I'm not sure how comfortable I am being called an "activist", mostly because I feel there are so many people participating in this more "actively" than I am. But the Occupy movement has certainly been a constant presence in my thoughts, and I will continue to help the Occupiers any way I can, even if it's just spreading their message.

Indy: What would you say to writers like Ginia Bellafante (author of a New York Times piece published last week that was critical of the movement) who imply that the movement is more spectacle than substance?  She wrote that the participants were "pantomiming progressivism rather than [practicing] it."

JM: She clearly hasn't been down there for much more than 20 minutes. And she clearly talked to only the craziest people she could find, people who would fit the stereotype she had already decided to write about. I think Bellafante also is manifesting the civic cynicism that characterizes many of those from the generation that had the misfortune to "come of age" during the Reagan administration. [Occupy Wall Street] is more truly, honestly progressive than anything else going on in American politics today. We will not make the same mistakes of 1968. The very things Bellafante says she did not hear people saying—worrying about "finding work, repaying student loans, figuring out ways to finish college when ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Justin Kuritzkes

Think about the Occupy movement as a piece of performance art rather than a
protest. Many of those involved will think that I am degrading the movement by
saying this. Many of its detractors will happily agree, ready to dismiss it with an
even swifter wave of the hand. Let me explain where I’m coming from.

One of the loudest criticisms of the movement – both from those who support it and
those who do not – is that there are no clearly stated demands. When I was setting
up my tent with some other students, members of the Providence community,
and participants of Occupy Providence on the Main Green this Friday for Occupy
College Hill’s One Night Stand (see here: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?
eid=289214534431646), we were approached by a young man who criticized our
movement, yelling, “What do you want. You can’t even tell me what you want!” We
were all pretty used to this sort of thing by this point, and we explained to the man
that he could find out what we wanted by talking to us individually, or by looking
at the pieces of poster board we had set up along the Green where people had been
writing their grievances throughout the day. He said: “But that’s too many things!
This is a protest! You can’t want all of that!” We explained to him that, yes, in fact,
we could want all that. He said: “But you all don’t agree on what you want!” We
explained to him that, yes, that sometimes happens when you bring a large group of
people together and ask them what’s wrong with their school, or their city, or their
country, and you give every person who shows up an equal opportunity to voice
their opinion.

We talked for about half an hour. When I passed that man in the street yesterday, he
smiled at me warmly.

The strength of our movement is that we are not protesting a single issue. I know
many people have voiced this already, but I think it’s worth saying again. We are
creating a space—in fact, we are creating many spaces all around the world (1500
and growing, last I checked)—where people who are not satisfied with the way
we are living can come together and have a dialogue about the ways in which we
might go about changing our system to better suit the needs of the vast majority
rather than the tiny minority. This may sound meaningless, but it is not. With most
protests, the agenda is decided by a hierarchical power structure, after which people
are invited to show up if they agree with the demands. The Occupy movement is
different: the gathering happens first, and then the demands (or grievances, or
strategies, or plans, or whatever) come second, the idea being that everyone who
shows up for the gathering can have a say in the larger movement. Sometimes
this turns into a petition of grievances and a proposed plan of action like this one
from Occupy Wall Street: https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/;

sometimes it turns into a man in a Guy Fawkes mask yelling that we should abolish
private property. The point of the movement is that no one, and everyone, is its
spokesman.

One of the things that irks me the most in the writing that’s come out about the
movement from students and intellectuals is the expression of a concern that the
movement will be co-opted by “the crazies”—the Anarchists, the Communists,
the Socialists. First, the movement cannot be co-opted by anyone, because there is
nothing to co-opt. Second, the Anarchists and the Communists and the Socialists
are not some sort of blemish on the face of the movement or some sort of disease
of which the movement must cure itself. They are already a part of the movement.
And so are you, and so am I. Part of the point of Occupy is to find out where all of our
various grievances and interests intersect. We are not in the business of telling the
radicals to shut up and go home so that the reasonable, level headed, well-educated
liberal progressives can hash things out. Occupy is not a radical movement, at
least as I see it, but it is a movement about bringing together the radicals, and the
progressives, and maybe even the Tea Partiers and having them talk to each other
and learn from one another to see what they can agree on.

As I’ve described it to my friends, it’s a lot like going to a concert by a band you
admire. Do you like everyone in the audience? No. Are there some people you’d
rather not be associated with who are singing along with you to your favorite songs?
Yes. Are there some people you find annoying? You bet. Are there some people who
you think like the band for the wrong reasons? Who don’t really get it? Of course.
So what do you do? It seems to me that there are two options: One, you decide
that being around these people is too distasteful for you to stomach, and you stop
going to this band’s concerts. Two, you use your shared love the band to investigate
the ways in which you and these people can come together and create something
beautiful despite your differences. If the concert is economic justice, then we are the
audience. The difference is: we are also the band.

Of course, sometimes you may find that you really don’t have much in common with
the other people who show up to Occupy, that you want totally different things,
or that your preferred methods for social change are irreconcilably different. You
may even find that, after trying to come to some common ground with a lot of these
people, you still sort of…don’t like them. That’s fine too. You can only hope that they
don’t make up the bulk of the movement. It is important to note that solidarity is not
about loving everyone. It’s not about singing kumbaya (though, frankly, if everyone
feels like it, why shouldn’t they sing kumbaya? It’s a beautiful song.) Solidarity is
about respecting each other and standing by one another as we fight toward our
common ends. It is also about preserving a non-violent space – meaning that, if
someone tries to start a mosh pit at our concert, we will throw them out and tell
them not to come back.

More important for the purposes of this article, however – and this is where I’ll
talk about performance art – Occupy seems to be about creating a visible space of
dissent in the public sphere. What strikes me as the single greatest contribution of
the Occupy movement is its role as a strobe light of agitation in the center of the city
– forcing people to examine their own relationship to and stance on the economic
injustice that seems to pervade our society, setting off any number of thought
processes, debates, and quests for individual education on the economy. Besides
perhaps getting people to look up the Dodd-Frank act (http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Dodd–Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) or the Glass-
Steagall Act (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass–Steagall_Act), or getting people to
look more critically at Rick Perry interviews (http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/
2011/10/25/10-questions-for-rick-perry/?hp), Occupy does what any good piece
of art does: It asks questions. In this light, it is not the job of the Occupiers to supply
the answers. It is their job to keep asking the questions—louder and louder, in more
and more places. This is what artists have been doing forever: trying to break the
taboo of asking certain questions so that eventually we may come upon the answers.
It has been a frequent criticism of artists that all they do is ask questions and never
give answers. There has always been a strain of criticism among art detractors
(particularly when the art concerns itself with political issues) that goes something
along the lines of: “Who are you to ask this question if you can’t give the answer?”
To this, I say, who was Shakespeare to ask: “To be or not to be?” At least he had the
gumption to ask. Most people didn’t. And before Occupy, most people didn’t have
the gumption to ask: “Why is it that the top 1% seems to be doing so well when the
rest of the 99% seem to be doing so poorly?” The answer is open, and the job of the
movement is to create room for it, not to supply it.

This is why, when people ask me what Occupy is about, I am almost as hard pressed
to give them an answer as when they ask me what one of my plays is about. Edward
Albee (who I like to quote a lot) says that when people ask him what one of his plays
is about, he replies: “It’s about two hours long.” He does this, he claims, not to be a
smartass (doubt that if you will), but because his plays are about much more than he
can succinctly explain in a reply. As Albee says: “Any play that can be summed up in
two or three sentences should be two or three sentences long” (for this interview,
go to: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/egg/305/albee/interview_content_1.html). I
feel similarly about movements: Any movement that can be summed up by a list
of demands should just be a list of demands. Plays are about everything, and so are
sonatas, and so are poems. Why shouldn’t movements be the same way?

When I was at Occupy Wall Street two weeks ago, I heard a chant that at first struck
me as kind of stupid. It sounded like exactly what the detractors of the Occupy
movement would like to hear from the mouths of the participants. It sounded like
exactly the kind of thing that could work to make the movement look ridiculous, and

unorganized, and chaotic. The chant was: “What do we want? Everything! When do
we want it? Now!”

Looking back on it, that chant seems just about right.<strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last June, President Barack Obama laid out plans for the beginning of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan, pledging to pull approximately a third of the 100,000 U.S. troops currently in the country by the fall of 2012, with most American forces expected to leave Afghanistan by 2014. In October, Obama announced that he would pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq by the close of the year 2011, stating at the tim<a href="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/asia_ARSF.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6078" title="asia_ARSF" src="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/asia_ARSF-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></a>e that the end of U.S. involvement in Iraq reflected a larger transition away from “the tide of war,” a trend which he said would continue as the nation attempts to shift more attention toward domestic priorities.

This November, Obama announced an agreement with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to keep U.S. Marines in the country on a rotational basis. About 250 will arrive next year in Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory, eventually increasing to about 2,500 and sending a message that despite widespread defense budget cuts and withdrawal from the Middle East, the United States intends to continue to assert itself as a Pacific power. In an address to the Australian Parliament following the announcement, Obama said he had “made a deliberate and strategic decision—as a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.”

“As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point,” proclaimed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, referring to regional policy in “America’s Pacific Century” in the November issue of Foreign Policy. She lays out an expansive case for increasing U.S. involvement in Asia, stressing the importance of maintaining peace, security and open markets in the region, which she argues will be a “key driver of global politics” in the years to come.  “Our economic recovery at home will depend on exports and the ability of American firms to tap into the vast and growing consumer base in Asia,” Clinton asserts, citing that last year American exports to the Pacific Rim totaled $320 billion.
<p style="text-align: center;">////////////////////</p>
The announcement of troop deployment in Australia came as part of Obama’s nine-day tour of the Pacific Rim, during which he hosted an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation free trade forum in Hawaii and attended the annual meeting of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During his visit, Obama became the first American president to participate in the East Asia Summit, which was founded six years ago as a diplomatic extension of the ASEAN and includes economic powerhouses such as China, Russia, India, and Japan. The President also held a previously unscheduled meeting with the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, during which they focused on economic issues, according the Thomas E. Donilon, the president’s national security advisor.

Contending with high domestic unemployment and discontent over the economy, Obama presented his trip in terms of its potential to create American jobs by increasing exports. “As the fastest-growing region in the world, no market is more important to our economic future than the Asia-Pacific—a region where our exports already support five million American jobs,” the President said.

However, the announcement of U.S. troop deployment in Australia, which marks the first long-term expansion of America’s military presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War, highlights another motivation behind the pivot in U.S. policy toward the Asia Pacific region—a desire to keep a growing China in check. Although Obama has said that “we welcome a rising, peaceful China,” asserting that “the notion that we fear China is mistaken,” renewed U.S. focus in the region is undoubtedly influenced by security concerns.

Although China’s true military budget is not made public, experts believe it has tripled over the past decade (though even these projections remain many times lower than current U.S. military spending). U.S. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has characterized the Chinese military buildup as lacking transparency, and Clinton claims that the U.S. seeks to clarify China’s intentions to “reduce the risk of miscalculation or miscues between our militaries.” However, Catherine Lutz, the Thomas J. Watson Jr. Family Professor of Anthropology and International Studies at Brown University says the idea that the Chinese are a threat to U.S. national security is “ludicrous,” explaining: “The Chinese are a main trade partner, they have our treasury bonds. There are so many reasons why the Chinese would not be interested in any kind of attack on the United States or attack on U.S. interests overseas,” Lutz told the Independent.
<p style="text-align: center;">////////////////////</p>
According to the BBC’s Nick Bryant, the deployment of 2,500 Marines is hardly a huge increase considering that there are about 100,000 American service personnel stationed in the Asia-Pacific in places like South Korea and Japan. However, the move signifies a deepening of the already close relationship between America and Australia, countries which have been allies for decades; Australians have fought alongside Americans in every war of the 20th century, as well as more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. “The United States has no stronger ally,” Obama said during his visit.

Lutz points out that in addition to the 2,500 troops, the United States will also be bringing in ships, aircraft, and vehicles. “China has rightly felt somewhat threatened by this,” she said. “It’s perceived as quite a provocative move on the part of the United States to open yet another military base [in the region].”

Indeed, China is not pleased by this development. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin regards U.S. military expansion in the Asia-Pacific warily, and has stated that “it may not be quite appropriate to intensify and expand military alliances and may not be in the interest of the countries within this region.” Some experts have expressed concern over what they perceive as America’s muscular approach to China’s increasing power, fearing that such moves could backfire, resulting in a cold-war style standoff.

Zhiquin Zhu, an associate professor of Political Science and International Relations at Bucknell University and the MacArthur Chair of East Asian Politics told the Independent that while he doesn’t think a cold war scenario is likely, he does worry that the deployment of troops in Australia will be “counterproductive” to relations with China. Zhu points out that “Darwin is awfully close to the South China Sea, so many speculate that the location of American troops in Australia is aiming [there].”

The South China Sea, a shipping lane for more than $5.3 trillion in annual international trade, is the subject of several disputes involving China and its South East Asian neighbors, as Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei all hold rival claims to parts of the waters. China claims ownership of the entire maritime region, which is rich in oil, minerals, and fishery resources, and has grown increasingly aggressive over its claims. Jiabao has warned the U.S. to stay clear of territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, stating that such conflicts ought to be resolved “through friendly consultations.”

However, many countries in the region welcome American presence as a counterbalance to China’s increasing military power, and the U.S. is eager to take advantage of diplomatic openings. During his Pacific tour, Obama announced that he would be sending Clinton to Myanmar, making her the highest ranking visitor from the United States to visit the country since the Burmese military seized power in 1962. Clinton’s diplomatic visit to a country previously shunned by the U.S. is a reflection of recent political reforms in Myanmar, though also clearly motivated by America’s desire to lessen the resource-rich, strategically located country’s dependence on China.
<p style="text-align: center;">////////////////////</p>
Obama’s trip to Asia was also spent firming up negotiations to join a free-trade bloc—the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a formerly little known but fairly liberal trade grouping—which would not initially include China. The TPP agreement was originally signed in 2005 by four countries with fairly small economies: Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. However, negotiations to secure membership for America, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam have been taking place for over a year. A recent statement by the leaders of the nine prospective TTP countries called the agreement a “milestone in our common vision to establish a comprehensive, next-generation regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues and 21st century challenges.”

Further TTP negotiations are scheduled to take place this December. The final agreement will reduce and ultimately eliminate most import tariffs within the group over the next ten years, a development which U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk claims will result in flourishing regional trade. Japan has also expressed interest in joining the bloc, a development which has been received with enthusiasm from the United States. The nine current TTP nations account for only six percent of U.S. trade, which is about the same fraction as American trade with Japan alone. In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, former U.S. trade representative Clayton Yuetter and international trade lawyer Jonathan Stoel asserted that with Japanese participation in the TTP, “trade in the Asia-Pacific region will explode. It could easily triple or quadruple.”

Obama has communicated that China would be welcomed to the new trade pact only if Beijing is willing to meet the free-trade standards for membership, which would require China to let its currency appreciate, to better protect intellectual property rights, and to reduce subsidies to state owned companies – demands which would require a significant overhaul of China’s current economic system. While some experts have labeled the TPP an attempt to “encircle” China economically, Zhu predicts that “a trade bloc across the pacific without China’s consent is unlikely to work,” considering that China is the largest trading partner in the region. Zhu points out that while many of China’s neighbors may be eager for U.S. military security to counterbalance a growing China, they also recognize that they benefit from China economically, and are likely to try to maintain strong relations with both powers.
<p style="text-align: center;">////////////////////</p>
Zhu emphasizes that much of the motivation behind Obama’s recent moves in the Asia-Pacific may be influenced by his upcoming re-election, explaining that the President “has to do something to show voters that he’s trying very hard, that he’s tough on China and that he can generate more jobs,” and saying that he is unsure to what degree recent negotiations in the region will represent long term policy. As Dean Cheng points out in a recent New York Times opinion piece, “what is unclear is how long this renewed effort will be sustained, especially in the face of budget cuts,” acknowledging that regardless of Obama’s intentions, “Fewer American resources, including reduced military capabilities, will dilute America’s ability to remain focused on Asia.”

However, Obama has stressed that budget cuts in Washington will not inhibit the administration’s renewed commitment to the region, stating that defense cuts “will not—I repeat, will not—come at the expense of the Asia-Pacific.” Clinton affirms the importance of U.S. engagement abroad, proclaiming that “maintaining peace and security across the Asia-Pacific is increasingly crucial to global progress, whether through defending freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, countering the proliferation efforts of North Korea, or ensuring transparency in the military activities of the region’s key players.”

“China is a challenge, there is no doubt about it, but at the same time China is also an opportunity,” says Zhu, acknowledging the potential for China to boost the U.S. economy and create jobs at home. Ultimately, Zhu says that although we may see periods of tension between the U.S. and China in the coming months and years, prompted in part by the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and power shifts in China, he is optimistic about the strength of the relationship in the long term.

Lutz agrees, explaining that she believes future relations between the U.S. and China will be positive “because we are so intertwined at this point,” which she claims generally makes for better relationships. As Clinton has asserted, China represents one of the most “consequential bilateral relationships that the United States has ever had to manage…The stakes are much too high for us to fail.”

Hokaku Jeffrey Maitland Ph.D has been involved in transitioning and translating Zen Buddhism into English since the 1970s. After receiving a Ph.D in Kant's aesthetics, he traveled to Japan to further his practice of Zen Buddhism. There he met his teacher, Japanese Zen master Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi who ordained him as a Zen monk (Roshi is known for being Leonard Cohen’s teacher.) Afterwards, he returned to teach philosophy at Purdue University and become a certified Rolf practitioner in healing.

In 2010, Maitland published his book Mind, Body, Zen: Waking Up to Your Life, a series of essays describing the philosophy, practice, and healing nature of Buddhism. Covering critiques of Derrida, meditation sitting posture, and the loss of self in romantic love, Maitland's book is accessible and authentic. Recently, Maitland sat down with a group of students studying Zen Buddhism under Brown Professor Hal Roth.

<em>Mind Body Zen: Waking Up to Your Life. North Atlantic Books, 2010. $16.95</em>

Why do you choose to use the word love when you describe Zen?

Jeffrey Maitland: My teacher says that when you go to zero, when subject and object become one, thats the expression of true love. Love is an experience. When you hold an infant, you just disappear into the sweet feeling. You feel the love of the universe in a very direct and clear way. And that's love: when its unencumbered, when theres no agenda and when theres no ego. Another expression of this is in kissing -- its a form of loss of self. And you know when to end it with a certain other kind of perception. It's the same process when your meditation takes you to a place of zero.

What is the effect of this love?

JM:When you go to zero, and you come back to the world, you see yourself as everything. It’s hard to describe. You are with everything in a different way. Its like having the best night of sleep of your life, getting the best cup of coffee in the morning, and your brain clicks on. You feel happy, open, spacious. And that shopkeeper who is always cranky seems a little kinder, because you're a little more open. And its perceivable.

What is the fundamental difference between Western philosophy and Zen Buddhism?

JM: It is the way of looking at how things got here. We always tend to see things as cause and effect, and as if we’re standing outside of them. Ultimately, these causes and effects necessitate a first reason for existence, which is usually God. That separates God from his creation. On the other side, Buddhism doesn't eschew anything: everything is included in the causation. It’s co-causal, happening simultaneously. Instead of God on the outside, the very nature of what is unfolding is the mysterious being. You can't taste it or smell it but you know it.

What happens to morality in Zen? Is there a Zen for psychopaths?

JM: No. The evil-doer is inaccessible to his own feeling nature. He wouldn't recognize in himself that the misery he is for others is part of the misery for himself.

How important are differences between cultures in grasping Zen?

JM: Carl Jung once said it was dangerous for Westerners to practice meditation because it would drive them crazy. I think that’s wrong. The correct understanding of Zen and one's own tradition has to be followed, and then one has to go through the process of making sense of one’s own experience authentically. The transmission of Zen to other cultures is part of an ongoing attempt to bring understanding into a coherent form on a universal level.

How does one creatively translate a Japanese tradition to America?

JM: Whats the opposite of the word aesthetic? Anesthetic. The aesthetic is about waking up. The experience of great art is Zen. From my work in the philosophy of aesthetic theory and Zen, I believe that freedom is the creative expression of limitation. And all things that exist are limited. An artist is perched in a tradition, and he has to know how to work within that tradition without getting caught up in the matter that he produces bad art. On the other side, he can't be so far into possibility that he steps out of the tradition and produces incomprehensible work. Like a great artist, Zen masters must know how to creatively appropriate the tradition to teach Americans.

What is the self?

JM: The self exists between the subject and the object, between incomplete minus and incomplete plus. The subject-object distinction is specific to Western philosophy. Often, Buddhists speak about the "self" in the same way that we do. But if you want to grasp this activity by which the universe appears and disappears, it’s critical to see how these two activities function together. The self is not just one of these activities [the “subject” or perceiver]. Instead, the self is what is created when each one of these activities gives us an aspect of the self. In Roshi's teaching, there’s a way to focus experience on the present moment that moves between two poles where subject and object are unified and separated. From the first unification, there is an expansion out and contraction. It's like breathing. You inhale (expand) and exhale (contraction). At those extremes, we don't feel a self. In between those states, during that process that is too fast to perceive, the self is created. The process gives us a sense that time is occurring, that we're moving around in time, and there’s a relatively fixed self. We need to recognize that we experience this expanding and contracting as a “self” that is alone a subject, but we also need to deny the ultimate, true reality of these fixed identities, fixed causes.

&nbsp;

In the moment we hit our head at a door, or lose ourselves in love, why does it make sense to talk about expansion and contraction?

&nbsp;

JM: The moment you bang your head, you're completely at one with that experience. Very quickly, you separate from that, and subject and object arise. What’s fascinating is that it’s rooted in a practice and experience that includes the conceptual ground.

Try an experiment. Close your eyes. Have your friend make a loud, sudden noise. Did you feel yourself disappear at that exact moment? Do you feel a distance between you and the object of perception? Where in your body felt open and spacious?

When you follow out the experience of full presence, and continue the practice, peace arises. Again, Zen is a practice, not a doctrine.

&nbsp;

So if there are no doctrines, how do koans, or Zen philosophical phrases, work?

&nbsp;

JM: Lately, I've taken to using a phrase: "Zen doesn't offer an explanation, but offers an alternative to explanation." People get hung on this first time they try to understand a Zen phrase, koan. They try to understand koans such as, "How do you catch a flying bird without touching it?" or, my personal favorite, "Why don't rocks go to church?" People respond, "well, rocks don't go to church because they're already one with everything". The koan sucks you in to giving it an explanation. It takes you a while to understand the obvious answer is not the answer to the koan, nor is it the solution to the problem of life. The practice is a realization.

		<title>Fracking Sweet: Gasland Documentarian Josh Fox Arrested at House Hearing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Josh Fox, director of the 2010 Oscar nominated documentary <em>Gasland</em>, was arrested today while gathering footage for its sequel, <em>Gasland 2: The Road Warrior</em>.  Fox was trying to videotape a House Science Committee hearing to investigate a recent EPA report that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, was responsible for the pollution of groundwater in Pavillion, WY.  According to Fox, he was unable to get the proper media credentials because the hearing was scheduled on short notice.  Despite the lack of response to his request to tape the hearing, Fox showed up at the hearing with a camera and a videographer, as did another unrelated crew from an ABC affiliate.

Although the hearing was public and already being videotaped for C-SPAN,  the chairman of the subcommittee responsible for the hearing is legally permitted to bar cameras.  House representative Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, <a href="http://www.stardem.com/news/local_news/article_e103cdb4-b313-5106-a39a-a1d567b85648.html">fracking superfan</a>, and part-time Waylon Smithers impersonator, objected to the presence of both camera crews.

<a href="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AndyHarris3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6179" title="AndyHarris3" src="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AndyHarris3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/0d0609ea8cdf1da0d7602865d6fdd0a6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6180" title="0d0609ea8cdf1da0d7602865d6fdd0a6" src="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/0d0609ea8cdf1da0d7602865d6fdd0a6-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

The committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Brad Miller, argued that the crews be permitted to stay.  After a brief recess (to gather any Republicans smoking in the bathrooms), a vote was called.  Fox was then handcuffed and led from the courtroom, reportedly yelling "This is a public hearing! I'm being denied my First Amendment rights," to which Representative Harris presumably replied with a hearty L-O-L.

Though the committee chair does have the authority to bar cameras from a public hearing, that authority is typically only exercised when there is overcrowding.  Today, however, Fox, his cameraman, and the crew from ABC were the only people in attendance.

But what is fracking?  Imagine that our nation's human rights and resources are natural gas, stored in and protected by layers upon layers of bedrock — in this case the constitution.  Now we need a fracker.  Since I already have his picture, why don't we use Rep. Harris.  If you can, mentally add a little hardhat to the image above.  Now he looks like the real fracker we all know he is.  In order to extract the contents from the bedrock, the fracker must first penetrate the bedrock with some sort of mechanical appendage, nice and deep like.  Next he pumps his noxious fracking fluid into the hole he has created in the bedrock, pumping and pumping until the rock can no longer stand the pressure of so much fracking fluid and bursts, releasing fracking fluid, natural gas, human rights, and mixed metaphors in every direction.  Some of that gas goes to the fracker, while some of it makes its way into the local drinking water, allowing locals the luxury of water they can choose to drink <em>or</em> light on fire.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The ten people driving out of the small Pakistani town of Miramshah on January 23 probably heard a distant buzz before a deafening explosion sent their car tumbling off the side of the dirt road. The passengers, later described as suspected militants by the United States and Pakistan, were incinerated on impact, their remains left inside the charred vehicle.
Their fate was decided more than 7,000 miles away when two pilots sitting in a virtual cockpit at an Air Force base in Nevada spotted the car on their screens. A pilot pushed a button, a drone responded, and the Hellfire missile took out its target.
Drones, otherwise known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are largely considered the next wave of contemporary warfare and have become a mainstay — and a major point of criticism — in the Obama administration’s ongoing War on Terror.
In addition to unarmed surveillance drones, the US operates two types of armed drone programs. The first is a publicly acknowledged operation led by the US military in declared warzones, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently Libya. The second is a covert campaign directed by the CIA primarily in Pakistan, an undeclared warzone.
Top Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders are known to have established strongholds in Pakistan’s tribal regions, where their followers launch attacks on US and NATO forces in Afghanistan. But because these areas are rugged and isolated, it’s nearly impossible for ground troops to stop cross-border attacks. “If not for drones, we wouldn’t be conducting cross-border strikes in Pakistan: there’s no way we’d send in troops—risking their capture or deaths—to take out ordinary suspected terrorists,” said Dr. Patrick Lin, Director of the Ethics and Emerging Sciences at California Polytechnic State University. “Osama bin Laden, I think everyone sees, is a special case.”
Drone warfare is widely credited with disrupting al-Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan, but it has seriously strained the US relationship with Islamabad, a key ally in the peace process in Afghanistan. The dynamic is dicey: Pakistan’s government publicly condemns drone attacks, saying they undermine national sovereignty, but it shares intelligence with the United States. A report from Reuters this week quoted am unnamed security official who confirmed that Pakistani intelligence is continuing to cooperate with the US in its drone campaign against the tribal areas. The official called two recent US drone strikes, on January 10 and 12, “joint operations” carried out by U.S. UAVs with the help of Pakistani “spotters.” He added that the intelligence agencies have a much better relationship with the US than do the political or military leadership.
But political tension has only increased since the US commando raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in May of 2011. Soon after, members of Pakistan’s parliament made a similar statement in which they “condemned the unilateral action, which constitutes a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty.” Seeing the US drone campaign as a symbol of this violation, civilians in May filled the streets of Pakistan’s cities holding signs with phrases like “No to US Drones. No to US Aid. We Can Stand By Ourselves.”
The civilian impact might be the greatest impact of drone warfare. But the question of carnage is a matter of heated debate: accounts of the strikes from official and unofficial sources are consistently contradictory. A recent study from the Brookings Institution suggests that drone strikes may kill “10 or so civilians” for every militant killed. In contrast, The New America Foundation estimates that 80 percent of those killed in attacks have been militants. And the UK-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism says that between 391 and 780 civilians were killed out of between 1,658 and 2,597 in total, and that among these deaths, 160 were children.
However, all of these estimates are at odds with the CIA’s account of the toll. The debate reached new heights in June, when President Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, said in reference to the drones program that “there hasn’t been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities we’ve been able to develop.”
The debate took another unprecedented turn this week. During his hour-long “White House Hangout” chat, President Obama confirmed that unmanned vehicles regularly struck Pakistan’s tribal areas. “For the most part, they have been very precise precision strikes against al-Qaeda and their affiliates,’’ he said. “And we are very careful in terms of how it has been applied. I want to make sure that people understand that actually, drones have not caused a huge number of civilian casualties.”

//////////////////////////
But even as the world debates the legal and social implications of unmanned combat, there continues to be little understanding of just how these mysterious weapons work. How does a UAV make it from Nevada to North Waziristan? Anyone involved in launching attack drones will tell you that these unmanned vehicles require much more manpower than their name would suggest.
“At the end, it’s always about people, no matter what,” said Asaf Gilboa, a former UAV operator for the Israeli Air Force and now the CEO of Themis Ltd., an international UAV consultant firm. There may be no pilot in the air, but from development and maintenance to navigation and battlefield management, there are a lot of people manning the journey of the drone.
The drone itself consists of five or six parts that can be disassembled, packed into a container known as “the coffin,” and deployed anywhere in the world. But inside that container is an entire system, with satellite communication equipment, cameras, sensors, lasers, rangefinders, and moving target indicators.
Long before materials are packed and launched, a drone’s journey begins with production and testing, which the US military outsources to private contractors. According to USAspending.gov, an official federal finance tracking website, US government drone purchases rose from $588 to $1.3 billion over the past five years. “The military is like a rich kid with a trust-fund. It wants to buy the finished product, and its interest is more in maintenance and operation than in actual development. So it hands over the money to private companies,” said Ricardo Valerdi, a professor of engineering at University of Arizona who works with defense contractors on UAV development. Companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing or General Atomics—together capturing about 80 percent of the UAV market in the United States—build the drones from start to finish.
From here, the private contractors deliver the final product to the US military, where the drone is synced with the two other key components of the operation: the cockpit on the ground and the data system that glues the whole mission together.
UAV pilots on the ground fly the drone as if it were any conventional aircraft, ready for takeoff with the joystick in their right hand. “It’s the same as the environment of the typical cockpit, but the pilot is displaced,” Gilboa, the Israeli UAV consultant, said. So, when the vehicle takes off, instead of viewing the field through a windshield, the pilot sees a rolling image streamed from a camera on the drone’s nose, inside a virtual cockpit.
The information relayed from the drone is fed to not only the pilot in Nevada, but to a host of other people as well. UAV missions “are about the movement of data instead of people,” Gilboa said. This is exactly what makes them so appealing from an intelligence standpoint. The pilot can be sitting anywhere, free from danger, and the images received in flight can be streamed anywhere—to legal advisors, to CIA personnel, to ground troops in Pakistan, and beyond. And thanks to this mobility of data, the decision-making process in UAV combat is much more complex than in traditional warfare.
“Pilots are looking at the screen, but they do not have ultimate decisions to do everything that they’re capable of. Other people looking may be people parked on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. Or it could be people at the Pentagon who are making the real decisions,” Valerdi said. “Say we are going to send the drone with a bunch of weapons on it, and depending on how that looks, there will be a bunch of people involved in that decision — and all of the social and political risks that it comes with.”
The risks are manifold.
“It is a human controlling an autonomous robot,” Valerdi said. “By the nature of this autonomy, they have a lot of divergent behaviors.” Pilots on the ground, for example, lack the same situational awareness and physical cues they would have in the cockpit of a jet. Instead of the pilots’ own senses, navigation relies on sensors. “A bunch of sensors are trying to find each other in an environment where there may be no GPS or no radio,” Valerdi said. If something abnormal happens in the air, hovering over Miramshah, there’s not much the pilots sitting on the ground can do about it.

////////////////////////

As the U.S. drone campaign moves into the public spotlight, it’s unclear what shape the program will take in the future. With defense spending cuts, drones seem to be an increasingly enticing option: they are cheaper than boots on the ground. And as troop withdrawal looms in Afghanistan, the military will likely turn more and more to remote warfare in Pakistan to quell al-Qaeda along the border.
If anything is certain, it’s that the drone is changing the face of contemporary warfare. A pilot flying combat drones over a warzone can finish his shift and drive a few miles off base to home be in time for dinner with his family. Yet this pilot has no normal day job: he may have just manned an operation that killed suspected terrorists in tribal Pakistan.
Once the drone was in flight, the pilot would have watched live-streamed videos from the field. The target—a vehicle filled with suspected militants, say—would be identified on the ground. The pilot would have the go-ahead to fire. And with a distant buzz and a fiery explosion, a missile piloted from Nevada would hit its target in North Waziristan.

		<title>BIRTH CONTROL UNCOVERAGE: ONE DOODLE THAT CAN BE UNDID, HOMESKILLET</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From teenage whoopsidaisies to one night stands gone unglamorously wrong, unintended pregnancies were big in the world of movies this year. But they have also been big in the real world, as prices for contraceptives became dramatically higher for college students and low-income women.

<!--more-->
Try as legislators might to assert themselves as women's advocates, they have a tendency to overlook practical, often complex factors that affect a woman's emotional and physical health as well as her sexual activity. Now add the stigma associated with birth control: a crutch for frivolous women intent on leading a capricious sex life. This sort of judgment is ignorant of the importance of birth control in preventing unintended pregnancies and abortions. It is also a total dismissal of the social and economic benefits that family planning provides to the nation's communities.
An example of this dissociation of women's issues--especially poor women's issues--is obvious in the recent price hike for hormonal contraceptives in low-income health clinics and university health centers across the nation. After passing the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which went into effect last year, Congress may not have foreseen the staggering effects it would have on low-income women's access to birth control. Although these effects are said to have been unintentional, Congress's oversight proves that it rarely does its homework on the potential consequences of its actions. Now it must do its make-up work.
<strong>No money, mo' problems</strong>
Women who rely on low-income and university providers have reported that monthly costs for oral contraception have risen by factors of two to four, according to the Associated Press. Prices for other forms of birth control, like NuvaRing, have increased by up to 900 percent at some clinics.
Before last year, pharmaceutical companies would sell drugs at discounts to a wide range of health care providers, colleges and low-income clinics among them. Drug manufacturers paid rebates to states for prescription drugs covered by Medicaid, the main federal health insurance program for low-income Americans. Since 1990, discounted contraceptives sold to university health centers and clinics were exempt from rebate calculations in an effort to encourage the discounts. This exemption didn't cost taxpayers a cent.
Things changed last January. When the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 went into effect, it brought an end to the exemptions for discounted contraception sold to university and safety net clinics. The intention was to end drug company fraud in rebate evasion. To fix the problem, legislators created a list of health providers whose business would excuse drug companies from paying the state. In an act of negligence, university centers and low-income health clinics did not make the list.
<strong>Rx-y business</strong>
With no more incentive for drug companies to provide discounts to college health centers, monthly prices for oral contraceptives are doubling, tripling, quadrupling. These changes translate to a rise in several hundred dollars per year at some schools, affecting the annual budgets of students at universities ranging from Indiana University, Texas A&M and Tufts to Duke and Brown University.
In The New York Times' November coverage of the price increases, Monica Davey noted that some people "wondered why college students, many of whom manage to afford daily doses of coffee from Starbucks and downloads from iTunes, should have been given such discounted birth control to begin with, and why drug companies should be granted such a captive audience."
This simplistic and ignorant judgment overlooks the extent to which the discounts have helped lower-income students, for whom the choice is seldom Starbucks or the pill--it's books or the pill. Of course, it would be na√Øve to ignore how companies profit from the business of young women when they sell birth control at lowered prices. For many students, it is their first time using hormonal forms of birth control, and it is in the manufacturers' interests to hook loyal customers. This motive, however, does not detract from the increased access to birth control that benefits students, whether they choose to use hormonal methods or not.
Many women who do not attend universities are also feeling the effects of the high price of birth control. These are women who can afford neither Starbucks nor iTunes and rely on low-income health clinics for their reproductive care. These important safety net clinics fill prescriptions for an estimated 500,000 women.
Some 400 community health centers nationwide used by low-income women have reported steep price increases in hormonal forms of birth control, and one quarter of Planned Parenthood clinics are ineligible for the price discounts. The price increases come at an especially difficult time for the nation's expanding number of poor and uninsured.
Health centers can no longer afford to offer the range of hormonal contraceptives that were previously available to students and low-income women. Non-oral methods like the patch and NuvaRing will no longer be carried by many university health centers. Some clinics, like the center at Bowdoin College, have stopped stocking prescription contraceptives altogether.
While the extent of damage inflicted by raised prices is still unclear, some college clinics have reported drops in contraceptive sales. The American College Health Association reported that fewer students are filling prescriptions at university health clinics, and an apparently corresponding number are asking for emergency contraception and pregnancy tests. This should be alarming not only to anyone concerned with women's health, but also to those intent on reducing the number of national abortions. It would be a no-brainer for both social conservatives and liberals to unite over the pill.
<strong>An ounce of prevention</strong>
For a woman, the option to plan if and when she wants children must be a fundamental right. It also has larger societal feedbacks. Reputable studies have shown that preventing medical mishaps--which usually end up burdening both the system and the patient--is cost-effective and beneficial to the larger social and economic structure.
The average cost for a one-year supply of birth control pills is $350, while the average cost for one pregnancy is $10,000, according to a 2004 study on contraceptive coverage in employer insurance plans. Yet more than one in four women across racial and ethnic backgrounds have reported difficulty obtaining, refilling or renewing prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives, even before the increase in price.
Almost 39 percent of American undergraduate women--three million students--use oral contraceptives, according to the American College Health Association. Young college-age women (18- and 19-year-olds) have a birthrate three times higher than high school-age women (15- to 17-year-olds), a fact that strengthens the argument that university health centers need discounts to help women prevent unwanted pregnancy and abortion.
To many people, oral contraceptives may seem like a luxury that can be cut from the monthly budget when it comes time to make ends meet. But for women who remain sexually active and do not want or cannot afford a child, hormonal birth control provides security against unwanted pregnancy that other forms of birth control cannot. Since convenience, simplicity and cost are key factors in determining whether or not a woman uses contraception, unaffordable prescriptions will only guarantee a greater number of unwanted pregnancies.
The US government has spent $1 billion on abstinence education programs, with no real benefit. In fact, the national teen birthrate just rose for the first time in 14 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal solution to the rising price of hormonal contraceptives on college campuses and for low-income women is simple, time-tested and free to taxpayers. There is every reason to restore the incentive for contraceptive discounts.
<strong>Pick up the slack</strong>
Late in 2007, lawmakers pushed for a correction of the new Medicaid law in a bill known as the Prevention Through Affordable Access Act. Among them were Representative Joseph Crowley (D-NY), Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). Despite bipartisan support and a quarter of senators and representatives signing on as cosponsors, the bill (H.R. 4054/S. 2347) remains floundering in the congressional sea.
Citizens of all sexes and budgets must demand that H.R. 4054/S. 2347 gain the momentum it needs. The majority of Americans are on board: 76 percent of all voters and 79 percent of voters who are conflicted about abortion support access to contraception as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies.
It is important to remember that the bill does not require pharmaceutical companies to again offer low prices to target providers. Lawmakers, candidates and voters must acknowledge the larger problems of nationwide medical expenses, access to health care and coverage the and concerns of American women and their personal security. Addressing these problems will significantly lower the strain on low-income women who are burdened with high birth control costs. Both leading Democratic presidential candidates have proposed plans for health coverage for all Americans, and these plans should come under scrutiny considering what hangs in the balance.
American women deserve options, regardless of their financial and academic situations. And for the near future, it is time to forge a health care for all. Nobody should have to rely on the whims of drug companies to plan for her chosen lifestyle.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eve Ensler says she is worried about the vagina. So are we. To paraphrase Eve Ensler's introduction to her acclaimed theatrical work, but in terms of our concerns rather than hers: We were worried about The Vagina Monologues. We were worried about what we think about the Vagina Monologues and even more worried that we don't think about it. People have gone weeks, months, sometimes years without interrogating it. So we decided to talk to men and women about The Vagina Monologues, to do a Vagina Monologues interview, which became The Vagina Monologues dialogue-an alternative to the overwhelmingly positive (and singular) response that the play and, specifically, a recent production on Brown's campus, have received, even in this very publication.

The Vagina Monologues seeks to form an open discourse around female sexuality. Does it accomplish this?

Woman: The play does present female sexuality and the vagina in a more vocal way than has ever been done before. In doing this, however, the monologues systematically exclude an entire segment of the population from the discourse that they purport to open. It's not people talking about the vagina; it's the vagina speaking through women and only women. If you have a vagina, you can express yourself, but if you don't, you're silenced. The penis is present in the play, but it is not allowed to speak. There's no man on stage. And I think this has the effect of silencing men in real life.

Man: Rather than starting a dialogue that would alleviate current tensions surrounding gender relationships, it seems to effectually bring women together in their own community of empowerment. I have to admit the whole thing has seemed like a kind of club to me.

What does the play offer to the male audience?

Woman: The things the play tells men are lessons. The vagina gets to dictate how men interact with it. Like, when they ask women "If your vagina could speak, what would it say?" the first response that all the women chant together is "Slow down!" Who is that directed towards? I really felt that play encourages laughing at men. People did laugh at that line.

Man: It's fine to create a community, but not if it's done using tactics that humiliate those who are excluded.

Woman: It's those same kinds of tactics that have been used against women for centuries, which merit a response like The Vagina Monologues. To really break that cycle, to really be something different, it seems like The Vagina Monologues should have a new and more inclusive method for approaching these problems.

Does the play allow women to regain control over the meaning of the vagina?

Woman: I think that those instances where the play addresses men are especially founded on the traditional idea that the vagina is an object of male desire. Its power over men relies on the notion that they want it.

Man: It's interesting that the play selects the vagina as the singular object of male desire. There's something curious about that, which recalls, for me at least, the phrase that a particular woman "likes the penis" as a euphemism for enjoying sex. That phrase, and the phrasing the play uses, seems to degrade the notion of equal, loving relationships between men and women.

Woman: I'm interested in that notion of the vagina as singular. Like it's a category. Instead of the vagina being a characteristic that some people have, vaginas happen to come with a woman attached. It's not the woman gaining control of what the vagina means, but the concept of the vagina becoming the sole definition of what it means to be a woman.

What do you envision as the effect of the abstraction of the vagina?

Man: Since the discourse of femininity as effected by the play is dominated by the vagina as an abstract concept, I believe that it has the effect of halting discussion. In a sense, the play presents the vagina as the vehicle through which women can become empowered, which it isn't. It's a body part, no more or less important than a finger, a nose or an ankle. As a body part it can't actually tell us what it thinks-

Woman: It can't actually think anything.

Man: Right. So rather than really engage people about the terms and concepts of womanhood, it loads everything on the vagina's ship and sends it out to sea.

Woman: That discourse isn't just in the play. It expands it to a whole culture or cult, which is reinforced by the continual performance of the play.

A cult of The Vagina Monologues?

Woman: Well, yes. As it's performed over and over again and year after year in the same places it becomes more of an event and meeting than a theatrical production. Many consider it a privilege to be involved with The Vagina Monologues and it's idolized by those who agree with its message, which encourages people to not consider it critically.

Man: I think that's the really sad part. Attending and appreciating The Vagina Monologues requires a lot of forward thinking, and it's a loss to have open-minded people become sycophants for the play, rather than having them further the discussion and push the thinking that the play itself opens.

How does it prevent critical examination?

Man: Well, for one thing, because it has been around so long, the play is kind of old news and so there's not really a call for criticism of it. I mean, at this point, you're either on the bandwagon, or you're not.

Woman: Also, there are the messages that the play hopes to embody: female empowerment and open discussion. They're hard to argue with. If you criticize it, you're immediately setting yourself in opposition to those things. Women are unlikely to take issue with the means the play uses, since the supposed ends are really progressive and beneficial for women.

Man: And men are not likely to take issue with it because by the nature of the play being The Vagina Monologues, they're excluded from the terms of membership, and naysayers would likely be seen not as intelligent critics, but simply as sour grapes upset at not being included. Likely, men would feel that people would see it as part of the perceived male desire to be on top of everything.

Why should men want to criticize it?

Man: Well, I think this comes back to the play addressing men directly. Men are part of the problem and since The Vagina Monologues is viewed by many as a solution, it's important for men in some way to enter the discussion. I think there are a lot of progressive men, especially on college campuses, where the play is most often produced, whose thoughts about the concepts and terms of femininity and male/female gender relations are valuable. Men have a lot to offer to the discussion and exclusion or isolation of the genders is ultimately a bad thing.

Woman: For whom?

Man: For everyone.

Woman: I think it denies men and women access to each other by setting up a relationship between men and the vagina rather than between men and women. And almost every example of a man's interaction with the vagina is extremely negative-men are child molesters or rapists or just plain disrespectful-they're never equal partners. The one positive male role in the play is in a monologue called "Because He Liked to Look at It" where a girl discovers how beautiful her vagina is because a man appreciates it. But, first of all, he doesn't appreciate it in a sexual way, there's still no positive image of male sexuality toward a vagina. All he does is stare at it. He keeps saying to her as she undresses "I want to see you" and he's talking about her vagina. I thought it was kind of sad-she actually says "I'm right here" and he says "no, I want to see YOU."

Man: The real woman is supplanted by the vagina and the male character is simply a voyeur. In a sense, he's emasculated. His desire to view the vagina is his sole definition as a character. And this hints at his implied desire to be a woman himself.

Do you hope to see a Penis Monologues in the future?

Man: No. The penis doesn't need it. The Vagina Monologues tries to establish a symbolic place for the vagina. This already exists for the penis. There are so many symbolic terms for penis in our language-phallocentric, phallic, the conflation of the penis and weapons-that it has accumulated an excess of conceptual meaning. I wonder if this is the real problem; that we've placed so much weight on such a stupid little body part. I don't really want to talk about my penis anymore than I'd want to talk about my shoulder or my finger or anything else. It performs a function, and I'm happy with that.

Woman: I wouldn't mind it, if it displayed some actual information about the body and allowed women into the field of discussion-things I don't think The Vagina Monologues does. It's valuable to talk about these things, to make each other comfortable with our bodies. It's just the methods of The Vagina Monologues I personally don't agree with.

If you could talk to The Vagina Monologues, what would you say, in two words?

Woman: Nice try.

Man: Up yours.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[EVE ENSLER IS WORRIED about vaginas. After over 200 interviews with women of all ages, races, creeds, and backgrounds, Ensler compiled a novel cross-section of contemporary female society into the play we know today as The Vagina Monologues. At once shocking and profoundly liberating, the Monologues have become a theatrical and social juggernaut, catapulting the word "vagina" into the American vernacular. By disentangling the many euphemisms associated with female genitalia and allowing the thing itself to stand bare on stage with no secrets, many credit Ensler with initiating a modern-day crusade to demystify the vagina. No small claim, indeed.

Ensler takes the word "vagina" and ensures its legitimacy as a subject. Having done so, the shock necessary to incite change inevitably recedes over time. Though not necessarily a bad thing (it has, after all, done its job), The Vagina Monologues risks being counterproductive if it makes the vagina too everyday, too mundane-in effect, just a word.

That said, the experience of watching The Vagina Monologues has lost none of its appeal as a validating project. It has created a community among women with similar experiences and perhaps similar fears and shame. Breaching everything from vagina behaviors to its links to identity and self-confidence, the play has simultaneously incited and capitalized upon a culture of vaginas that has moved far from the historical climate of silence.

The Eccentric Tulip

The vagina as black hole. The vagina as lack. We're all familiar with the array of vagina concepts populating university discourse, or what I call the "Academic Vagina." Freud and Lacan aside, what these ideas translate into in contemporary women's conceptions of "that thing between their legs" is the opinion that the vagina is a void, a nebulous nothing that, though convenient for wearing pants and crossing legs, isn't so interesting or empowering.

That's where The Monologues come in. With the word itself in the title, Ensler's play has catalyzed a culture of vaginas with a canon of stories and a vocabulary of its own. The Vagina Monologues began a revolution that affects women everywhere: us, our mothers, our grandmothers. Aiming to spare no one, the play created and continues to create a community of vaginas united in the phenomenon of menstruation, the frustrations of the wonders of the body, the pleasure and pain of sex, and the links to self-identity and acceptance.

The Vagina Monologues has been presented on college campuses all across America (including a production at Brown last weekend) stimulating a new generation of vaginas. The sudden surge of performances on college campuses is a testament to its tremendous popularity if not reputation that now more than ever precedes itself. In fact, the V-day website itself (vday.org) has published that in the year 2004 alone, 624 schools put on benefit productions of the play, raising a total of $2,137,345.11. But especially in communities that like to think of themselves as liberal and open-minded like Brown University, the question of audience comes to the fore.

Though the same shock that came from the mention of vaginas is absent from our neck of the woods, last weekend the play still carried weight with its College Hill audience. Why? Ensler's writing is as witty and biting as ever. It garners the same laughs, but certainly not the same novelty. With a University internet forum overflowing with posts about masturbation, questions of bodily behavior normalcy, and genitals themselves, there's no shortage of outlets for this sort of conversation. What draws people to see The Vagina Monologues, then, is a combination of its well-known popularity and its power to provide a sense of validation. Here, women come not to be shocked or to witness the shattering of taboos, but rather to hear familiar stories of coming into one's sexual own, to laugh at vagina accidents, and to feel special about their womanhood.

The Vagina And The World

Ensler's irreverence and wit have been translated into the languages of over 24 countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, Germany, France, China and Japan. The play has crossed national borders and indeed opened up a vagina dialogue. But how present are the cultural voices of these countries in the actual text? Not very, if at all. However diverse in age and manifold in tone and subject, the Monologues are still written from and American perspective and for an American audience. Ensler's voice is unabashedly American with its use of slang and its experiential pool drawing from uniquely Western and specifically American cultural and social institutions like dating. A somewhat retrospectively problematic lack in the play, it is nonetheless frivolous to assign unrealistic global expectations to Ensler. The project necessarily started at home with as diverse a group of women as could be gathered. The genesis of the vagina dialogue had to start somewhere in order to even begin giving a voice to women and their vaginas.

Rather than The Vagina Monologues ipso facto, it is the dialogue the play has initiated that will scale the globe. Though the play itself may stop at our borders, the future of the vagina dialogue is indeed a global one, and necessarily so.

This global future is fast becoming provocative. Just last month in the country of Uganda, the play was banned in the week before its debut in the capital city of Kampala. According to the BBC, the Ugandan Media Council cited the reasons for the ban to be in the play's glorification of homosexuality. It said the performance could continue if the production organizers "expunge all the offending parts." One of the play's organizers responded, "I am extremely outraged at the hypocrisy. I'm amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up."

I Think I Broke My Clit

While stories centering on the vagina still provoke outrage in many cultures, in an American context, it is easy to critique The Vagina Monologues for its complacent and liberal use of the word "vagina". Bordering on overuse and resulting in ineffectiveness, how many times can someone say "vagina" without wearing off its power and even its magic? If too many secrets are revealed, how can the vagina exist after it has become too exposed, too emptied? Is there a line between healthy discussion and driving the subject into the ground? In a time where tampon commercials reveal even the gritty details of that-time-of-the-month, it's hard to reconcile the need to speak the language of the vagina with a simultaneous desire to keep its grace in mystery.

But isn't the vagina in all its guts and glory graceful? Seeing the reactions across campus recently, hearing women talk about how validating the play was, how refreshing its treatment of vaginas, it's tough for the aforementioned criticisms to hold firm. At the end of one of the monologues entitled, "The Flood," an elderly interviewee addresses the audience. "You happy? You made me talk - you got it out of me. You got an old lady to talk about her down-there. You feel better now? [Turns away; turns back.] You know, actually, you're the first person I ever talked to about this, and I feel a little better." Though somewhat diminished in its previous novelty, vaginas are still healthy and buzzing topics of discussion.

The Vagina Monologues place vaginas on the conversational map. However far past its zenith of innovation and effectiveness, audiences are still laughing and the play is still raising money for important causes. When actress Glenn Close writes of The Vagina Monologues' Eve Ensler that "You don't just hook up with Eve, you become part of her crusade. There's a corps of us who are Eve's army" it is not to elicit fears of militant, vagina-wielding feminists.

Though some of us may still be waiting for a complementary Penis Monologues, Eve Ensler has ultimately succeeded in her project of dispatching an approachable army of empowered, orgasming, well-loved, happy, brave vaginas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've never heard Regina Spektor's music, your life is probably a little sadder than it would otherwise be. Spektor, a classically-trained piano player, writes lyrics as wild as Joanna Newsom's and has a voice as strange and seductive as Björk's.

On her album Soviet Kitsch, just given a major rerelease by Sire Records, Spektor pounds piano keys, knocks drumsticks against furniture, name-drops Fitzgerald and Hemingway, and breaks various glass objects-all in 38 minutes.

Born in Moscow and raised in the Bronx, Spektor attended the Conservatory of Music at SUNY Purchase; after graduation, she began playing shows in and around New York City. She gained a group of devoted fans and released two independent albums: 11:11 and Songs. A meeting with producer Gordon Raphael led to the recording session that yielded Soviet Kitsch-and a US tour with the Strokes.

Regina Spektor has been feverishly promoting Soviet Kitsch. During a recent email correspondence with the Indy, she discussed the literary, the surreal, and more.

Independent: Your songs often include allusions to literary figures: Samson, Oedipus, Ezra Pound. What are your reading habits like? Do you have any favorite books and/or authors?

Regina Spektor: Yeah, I love books and papers and words. My reading habits, like all my other habits, though, are completely inconsistent. So sometimes I read and read and read, and other times I just listen and look. Sometimes I read one book at a time, but often I have a few things going at the same time. I love Chekov, Tennessee Williams, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Tolstoy. Bulgakov's Master and Margarita is one of my favorite books-but this feels silly, like I'm naming only a few things in a huge well of loved books/authors. Hesse, Dumas, lots and lots of poetry, Kurt Vonnegut, etc.

I: How old were you when your family immigrated to the United States? Do you have any particularly vivid childhood memories of Russia?

RS: I was nine and a half. The half was super-important at the time. I have countless vivid memories of Moscow, and of Parnu (Estonia, where I spent all my summers as a kid), and of immigration through Austria and Italy. It's all this colorful adventure.

I: I find your songs very unique and compelling-both musically and lyrically. Could you describe your songwriting process? Which element of a song usually comes to you first?

RS: I guess, usually, I write it all together. The words and the piano part just come to find where they sit together, and the sounds and everything just kind of roll around over and over, until it all settles as a song. Sometimes I'll hum while walking and write a song, but usually I can never figure out a piano part to it later. It just stays an a cappella song. ["Aching to Pupate," from the album Songs, is a great example. -Ed]

I: Your press release quotes you as saying that touring with the Strokes was "surreal and educational at the same time." Could you describe one moment of that tour which was particularly surreal? And one that was particularly educational?

RS: I think the Strokes were such brave fans to take me on the road. I had never gone on a tour before; I had never even played a club bigger than 300 people. But they really believed in sharing my songs with their fans. Many, many educational things: I had never been on the West Coast, or to the South, before that tour. And to play night after night opening for a band that you love, and to play venues like Theater at Madison Square Garden, where your name is lit up on the marquee, is pretty surreal. I remember walking toward Madison Square Garden and seeing it just as it light up. Strange stuff.

I: Soviet Kitsch has been available at your shows and on cdbaby.com since last year; now it's being released on Sire Records. What brought you and the album to this label?

RS: Sire is an amazing NYC label, and they were starting up again after a long sleeping hibernation period. It was just the right situation and the right people at the right time. I am so happy there right now, and my record is in stores for the first time in this country. They really wanted to re-release it, and I wanted it to get heard.

I: Because you were still unsigned when you toured with the Strokes, you had to cover all of your own expenses. This, clearly, was one disadvantage of being an unsigned artist. But were there any advantages to being unsigned? In other words, is there anything that you miss about it?

RS: Mostly, the things I've gained-a lot of support and a company that works alongside me to promote my music-are much more than what I've given up. I was very careful to retain my creative rights; I wasn't going to sign to any label if it would compromise my music and what I was trying to do. But there is definitely a bureaucratic element that comes with working in every company. Things have to go through a chain of people to be approved. So far I've been very lucky, I don't take it for granted. I'm very aware that the tide can turn. Before I was signed, all I had to do was decide on something and then save up money and work with friends to try and get it done. Now it's a slower process, but there are more people helping and working-so when it does get done, it's in a bigger way.

I: What have you been doing in the past month or so to promote Soviet Kitsch? Do you have any tour plans?

RS: I've been doing so, so much: playing shows, doing press interviews and TV and radio stuff. Makes me nervous, but it's for a good cause. I'll be playing a US tour from the 24th of March to the 21st of April. Then I fly to Paris three days later. After that I play a UK tour. So I'll be on tour for about two months, ending around the middle of May. Pretty intense stuff.

I: Last month I saw you perform here in Providence with the Dresden Dolls. The venue was being very strict about how much time you were allowed. There was a big digital clock on the stage, I remember. It was incredibly sad to see you have to rush through your set. I would love it if you came to Providence again.

RS: Yeah, they were so strict, bordering on mean, actually. I do hope you'll get to see a less rushed show someday. Though I won't be in Providence this time around, maybe I'll see you in Boston, or next time. Take care, yo.

If you ask her nicely, ALEXANDRA DE JESUS B'08 will make you a mixtape.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s kind of wonderful the way kids scare the adults who created them. So for anyone who’s ever enjoyed not so much the group of hooligan teenagers, but rather the old lady cowering behind a mailbox as they pass, this year’s Sundance Film Festival certainly had the goods.

A notable portion of the entries dealt with the delinquency, violence, drugs, and generally unsettling behavior of Generation Y. Out of the half-dozen flicks portraying youngsters at their worst behaved, a standout in the American Spectrum category was Born Rich, a documentary about the offspring of the extremely loaded.

Without having any of the darker and potentially criminal conduct of the other movies, Born Rich made a big impression courtesy of the breath-taking douche-baggery affected by some of its participants.

The complications of the kids’ wealth, their current privileges and future inheritances, and the ever-pervasive paranoia about being “cut off” are detailed through trips to country clubs, shopping sprees, Great Gatsby-themed birthday bashes, and interviews with ten cohorts of the film’s director, Jamie Johnson. The 23-year-old is a particularly qualified tour guide for the subject, being the crown prince of Johnson & Johnson pharmaceuticals. Born Rich is a who’s who of kids to rob at gunpoint: other expensive last names patrolling NYC in the film belong to Ivanka Trump, SI Newhouse IV, Michael Bloomberg’s daughter Georgina, and Josiah Hornblower of the Vanderbilt and Whitney broods.

And glory be to Brown University. For lo, emerging from such illustrious competition to steal the show is Luke Weil, Brown class of ‘02 and heir to the Autotote casino gaming empire.

Weil consistently outshines his affluent co-stars when it comes to colorfully expressing his contempt for the proletariat. Wisdom such as A&P heiress Juliet Hartford’s solemn meditation on what she would do with 1 million dollars (“I’d give it all away to the homeless—ha ha just kidding!”) are no match for Weil’s prodigious knack for gems like “If someone from some shitty little town in Connecticut is pissing you off [you can say] fuck you, I’m from New York and my family can buy your family.” While many of us curse those 93 exits of wrist-slitting fun some people call Connecticut as just a nuisance between NYC and PVD, rarely have both the dignity of an entire state and the existence of the soul been so neatly and simultaneously dismissed. Weil also has little respect for the institution of holy matrimony. When asked about marriage, the scion of Autotote has the following suggestion: “If this little ungrateful bitch has the nerve to [balk at a pre-nup], she’s just a gold digger and not worth it anyway.”

Clearly, this movie kicks ass. However, Weil apparently disagreed, suing in New York State Supreme court in Manhattan to block the release of Born Rich before Sundance submissions were due in November. Perhaps the humble fellow, who brags on camera about taking LSD in 6th grade, sued out of modesty. But it was probably because he felt the film “tricked,” “embarrassed,” “humiliated,” and made “him an object of disdain, derision and obloquy.” In any case, the suit was unsuccessful. As it turns out, Weil had already signed three extremely unambiguous releases for Johnson, and prior restraint claims against the First Amendment when three unambiguous releases have already been signed are about as useful as Stephen Hawking’s gym membership. Justice Shirley Kornreich found the request “presumptively unconstitutional,” sending Weil, Johnson, and Born Rich on their merry way.

Unfortunately for all of us, Born Rich has not yet been picked up for distribution. But rest assured, the film will surely one day attract an audience. For now though, Born Rich and its revelations will have to wait, conspicuous but peculiar; familiar but exotic; idiotic but who cares, like a Hummer outside Viva.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By all means, the writers' strike has atrophied, stagnated. The faces of our nation's creative elite remain comically dressed in full, grizzly beards that recall the bygone era of transcendentalism. The strike has been a return to what's natural, to what we are endowed with as human beings in our germinating, creative minds.

<!--more-->
Yes, voices are speaking up, but they don't seem to penetrate the soundproof walls of corporate towers in New York, or cross over the multi-million dollar manicured lawns of executive producers in Los Angeles. For however much the writers' outcry doesn't seem to reach their intended audience, it has gained recognition with the audience¬≠--us--that they're used to addressing.
We are beginning to recognize that the content of our favorite shows and movies is not the manifestation of the actors we've idolized for so long. The Wizard's curtain has dropped and we've found the man turning cranks and pulling strings. Yet this emergence from anonymity is anomalous in the face of our current understanding of entertainment. With a sourceless media streaming from the internet, fads in entertainment are seen to be less a product of skill than chance. A young girl from the Netherlands can sit in her bedroom one second, singing songs, then flash. She's ready for the limelight.
One can't help but realize that the plight of these writers is the direct inverse of this over-exposed internet pop phenomenon. Their wish, essentially, is to receive proportionate royalties for work distributed through what is contractually termed "new media." So it is the content generated from not-so-random sources that they feel deserves accreditation and its due pay. But the writers' strike is beyond ratios of money gained as opposed to money earned. It's essentially a reclamation of creativity.
Content is not produced spontaneously, nor is it faceless. Entertainment writers in America fuel a hit machine that spotlights other comedians and actors with their jokes and lines. Writers should be compensated for their work; that much is clear. But the increasingly histrionic means by which the Writers of America are attempting to thrust themselves into the popular consciousness, usually concerned only with the traditional beneficiaries of their craft, are the wrong ones. The endless march of Youtube videos that writers have been producing does not call attention to what it should--the writer's craft. Even the most serious of them are entertaining and enjoyable. They undermine what ought to be the true purpose of the strike, instead providing us with entertainment that we can feel free to enjoy, as always, without duly considering the process behind it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>PARKING WARS!</strong>
"By day we tow, we boot, we write tickets / By night we pop softballs 'cause you know we wicked" raps Sean, the supervisor of the Philadelphia Parking Authority in a promo video for A&E's new reality series "Parking Wars" (Tuesdays at 10pm EST). The show offers the average citizen, frustrated with $10 parking tickets and vehicles towed-at-the-owner's-expense, a voyeuristic look at the intrigues of their enemy: the strict enforcers who dole out parking violations like Halloween candy. Viewers also encounter the Booting crew, the Tow Squad, and the Impound Lot staffers.

<!--more-->
The episodes are filled with run-ins between PPA employees and Philadelphian parkers incensed with being fined, booted or towed as a result of their own irresponsibility. The result is a cross between "Candid Camera" and "Punk'd"--the antics of the people on "Parking Wars" are as amusing as in the former, but, as much as I don't want Ashton Kutcher popping up in my living room, it's hard to believe this writers' strike-spawned nonsense actually made it onto television.
If Philadelphia has parking problems resulting in on-camera hilarity, imagine a Nor' Easterner scuffling with a meter maid on Wickenden. (A spin-off perhaps? That first "P" in PPA could easily be changed to Providence.) Rapping meter men toting yellow car boots aside, in Providence--a city with an inexplicable ban on overnight street parking--residents may already feel put-upon when it comes to their cars.
Those who are careless in driving but confrontational in matters of traffic fines in Rhode Island face not only an all-mighty Traffic Tribunal, but also the pending power of the state's Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank J. Williams.
Last Tuesday, a bill passed the Rhode Island Senate that is set to curb democracy by taking non-criminal traffic omnipotence away from the elected District Court Chief Judge and giving it to the appointed Williams. If Governor Carcieri signs the bill, the Justice will have the power to appoint the magistrates that sit on the Traffic Tribunal. The consequences? No more redress for citizens who have fallen victim to speed traps. No lobbying from the anti-impound interest. No electoral process abating the sting of parking tickets. Even without A&E's producers nudging along the action, these developments in Rhode Island's traffic and parking justice system could provide fodder for hysterical, or at least comparably entertaining, television.
Sean finishes with a reminder of the gravity of traffic law enforcement: "This ain't little league T-ball this stuff is real / And when we step up to the plate you know the deal / You feel the power, the pain, the thrust / You're eating dust with the PPA enforcers /You can't mess with us."

<strong>LIBERT√â, √âGALIT√â, HILARIT√â</strong>
In an unprecedented round of navel-gazing, Great Britain is embarking on a quest to establish what it means to be British. Prime Minister Gordon Brown's new government introduced several pride-boosting measures during the summer of 2007, sparking intense debate about the attempt to codify British-ness.
The initiatives seek to define citizenship, outline a bill of rights and duties for citizens and even write down an official constitution. Other plans include creating a "British Day," opening a museum of British-ness and changing the national anthem, "God Save the Queen," due to its anti-Scotland origins. "It's surprising that it's taken them 250 years to realize that it's not inclusive," said Scottish Parliament member Brian Adam last month.
But the proposal drawing the most fire (and ridicule) is the push for a "statement of values" that defines the essence of being British, much as the Declaration of Independence sums up the lofty ideals of the United States. Detractors of the idea deride it as merely the Prime Minister's desire for a snappy slogan to plaster onto buildings and souvenir mugs.
Still, the measure appeals to more than a few Britons, drawing no less than the House of Lords into the debate. Although Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, a Ministry of Justice official, told The New York Times that there were no plans to adopt a motto, other officials happily brainstormed ideas. The Earl of Mar and Kellie suggested that the British adopt the Scottish motto, "Nemo me impune lacessit," which he rendered from Latin as "Do not sit upon a thistle." (Really, it means "No one attacks me with impunity.") Others in the House of Lords offered up snippets of their favorite poems or the slogans of English football clubs.
But the general public's objection to the idea of a national motto is perhaps the truest indication of the overarching characteristic of British-ness: that it is beyond definition.
In a farcical response to the idea of a British slogan, The Times of London sponsored a motto-writing competition; the winner, favored by 20 percent of readers, was "No Motto Please, We're British." Says the slogan-writer, David Bishop: "This idea of a statement of British-ness--I cannot think of anything less British than that."

<strong>
CAN'T SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES</strong>
In a case of environmentalism gone very wrong, a Sunnydale, California couple is appealing a conviction for refusing to chop down the grove of redwood trees in their backyard. Mark Vargas, the couple's next-door neighbor, filed a complaint that the redwoods cast too much shade on his rooftop solar panels--and a California law agrees with him.
California's 1978 Solar Shade Control Act was intended to guarantee that solar power users wouldn't lose money on their environmentally conscious investments due to the proximity of overly shady trees. Richard Treanor and Carolynn Bissett, the first California citizens to ever be convicted of a crime for growing redwoods, must pay a fine of $1,000 per day if they do not cut down the trees within 30 days.
Vargas, who has used his 10-kilowatt system since 2001 and drives an electric car, complains that the trees reduce the amount of electricity he can generate. He currently pays about $60 per year in electric bills.
Treanor and Bissett consider themselves environmentalists as well. They drive a Prius and began planting redwoods along their property line in 1997 as a means of erecting a nature-friendly privacy screen. Since then, the eight trees have grown to heights ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall.
The couple is appealing because they are worried about the precedent their conviction would set. "We could be done with this and walk away," Bissett told the San Jose Mercury News. "But then this could start happening in every city in the state."
Although Ken Rosenblatt, the Santa Clara county deputy district attorney for environmental protection, insists that the case is not about whether "trees are more or less important than solar collectors," other environmental advocates have sided against the redwoods. "It's actually better for the environment to put solar [panels] on your roof than to plant a tree," says Kurt Newick, the chairman of the global warming committee of the Loma Prieta Sierra Club and a solar panel salesman. Clearly, no conflict of interest shapes Newick's environmentalism.
Meanwhile, Treanor and Bissett hope that the preservation of the redwoods will outweigh the importance of manmade stopgap measure environmentalism. "We support solar power," says Bissett, "but we thought common sense would prevail."

<strong>INDIA GOES ORGAN-IC</strong>
Remember when you were a kid and your uncle Bill would come babysit for you? After he'd primed the pump with a few Colt 45 tallboys and you'd both finished watching Fire Down Below on VHS for the twelfth time, he would start in on the "scary" stories. Like the story about that friend of his he'd worked with down on the rigs, who was driving home from the "needy" part of town one night when he saw a car driving along with its headlights switched off, but when he signaled for them to turn their headlights on, they followed him home and slaughtered him in some esoteric ritual of gang initiation? Or the one about the guy who was sneaking hash across the border from Morocco and got caught with a handgun in his glove compartment and was taken under arrest and found guilty and then his hand was chopped off by the police, and then something else happened that he can't quite remember, but it was kind of important, and then while someone was driving away there was a hook hanging from the window? Or the guy ("let's call him... Phil") who went down to Mexico and then came back six months later driving a black BMW with Colombian license plates?
It turns out that one of his stories actually ended up being true. (Well, two, if you count the one about the BMW.) One of your uncle's favorites was about why you shouldn't sleep with prostitutes. Invariably, he claimed, one of those "whoo-ores" would slip a drug into your drink, and you would wake up, naked, in a bathtub full of ice, missing one of your kidneys. As far as we know, this has never happened in the US. However, it has happened in India. In fact, according to the Guardian, it has happened over five hundred times. Five people, four from Greece and one from Britain, have been arrested for allegedly luring in poor rural workers to Delhi with false promises of job opportunities. Once the workers arrived in the big city, they were informed that there was no work but that they would be paid handsomely to give up one of their kidneys. Those who did not consent were forcibly restrained, drugged, and then robbed of their nephritic organs anyway.
The kidney racket is apparently big money down in India, where selling one's kidney can earn you up to $2500. In a cruel but predictable twist of economics, the same kidney earns the middleman almost 50 times that much on the black market. Organ dealing has been illegal in India for more than a decade, but critics argued that the law has simply driven the practice underground. Which, once again, just proves why more prophetic minds like your uncle Bill's are needed in these troubling times. And more ponytails like Steven Seagal's.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["It's all about race," insisted Gladys Gould at a rally titled "Unite for Fairness" on Saturday, January 20 in Pawtucket. "The police will stop us because of the way we look." Gould spoke about challenges faced by immigrants, especially Spanish-speakers, in a sometimes openly hostile Rhode Island. The rally was organized by several organizations that seek to improve the lives of immigrants, including Ocean State Action and the Providence Presbyterian Church. Organizers hoped both to create a feeling of unity within the immigrant community and to take a stand against those who discriminate against and criminalize all immigrants.

<!--more-->
Ivette Luna, another rally attendee, pointed to the role of the state government: "The people on the Hill are feeding into anti-immigrant statements." Luna was alluding to two bills recently introduced to the House and the Senate. One, intent on reducing illegal immigration, plans to implement a statewide employee verification system, E-Verify, which enables employers to crosscheck names, pictures and social security numbers of employees. The other seeks to make English the state's official language.
<strong>Verify this</strong>
The bill that calls for the E-Verify program passed the House last year and will likely pass the Senate; 27 of 38 senators are co-sponsors. Supporters claim it will deter undocumented immigrants from entering the state (how they plan to inform prospective immigrants of the new system remains unclear). According to the Providence Journal, bill sponsor Representative Jon D. Brien thinks the program will send a message "that if you want to live in Rhode Island, you need to do it legally."
The senators proposing the implementation of E-Verify, Brien and Senator Marc A. Cote, are frustrated with the lack of federal leadership on curbing illegal immigration. Cote told the Journal, "If we are serious about enforcing our immigration laws, and to protect honest employers that abide by the law, I believe this proposal is a viable solution to the current problem." Brien added economic reasons for taking action: "Rhode Island has a great safety net of social programs for citizens who need help, but unfortunately, that's a draw for people who are in this country illegally. Especially at a time when our state has a deficit to reduce, we can't afford to shoulder that kind of burden."
Playing to the desire to balance the budget may win E-Verify support, but critics say the program will place the burden of proof on all immigrants, documented and undocumented alike. E-Verify assumes employees' guilt, or at least the high possibility of it. This has racial and linguistic implications, as does the second bill calling for the imposition of English as Rhode Island's official language.
<strong>Se habla ingl√©s</strong>
The Rhode Island English Language Affirmation Act of 2008 is a revival of a similar bill that died in the House last year. The bill's sponsor, Representative Kenneth Carter, has Governor Carcieri's support. He cites the 27 other states that have adopted similar official language policies as examples for Rhode Island to follow. In a press release, Carter said the bill's purpose is to "encourage every citizen of this state to become more proficient in the English language," so that they can "participate more fully in the economic, political and cultural activities of the state."
Those opposed contend official language policies are a masked attack on immigrants, especially those of Hispanic origin. Such a policy can represent reactionary nativism that favors a narrow view of American linguistic and cultural history. Senate President Joseph A. Montalbano told the Journal that the bill "unnecessarily targets people that don't speak English and are doing the best they can to make it in this country." Others say the bill, rather than encouraging learning, unfairly punishes non-English speakers without offering them alternatives like ESL classes.
In Pawtucket, Luna called for education for both immigrants and native Rhode Islanders. "The key is education. We need the true facts. It's all about human. We all are people. We are all immigrants. An injustice to one is an injustice to all."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rogerwilliams_CECILIA.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6998" title="rogerwilliams_CECILIA" src="http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rogerwilliams_CECILIA-275x300.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="300" /></a>

In 1817, a book was donated to Brown University’s John Carter Brown Library. Either because it never had a title page or because it has been destroyed by age, the exact title, author, and year of publication of the book itself are still unknown. The “PREFACE by the author <em>To A Certain Person of Judicious Quality</em>” is followed by a treatise entitled “An Essay Towards the Reconciliation of Differences Among Christians,” a dull tract which uses scriptural evidence to justify the Reformation and its aftermath.

Far more interesting than the book itself are the handwritten marginalia filling literally every inch of unprinted space. At first glance, they almost look like Roman or Arabic characters that are slightly out of focus. On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the characters are neither—they are more geometric than either of these alphabets—and some seem to be crude drawings of ships or planets. Parts of sentences are written in English, and most of the symbols are repeated. The book came attached with a note from its donor, an equally mysterious T. Tweedy, attributing the encoded shorthand marginalia covering every page to Rhode Island’s radical preacher-founder, Roger Williams.

•♦•♦•♦•♦•♦•♦•

Although the library has had the book for almost two hundred years, there wasn’t much interest in the book or the code until last spring, when the 350th anniversary of Rhode Island sparked a renewed interest in Roger Williams. A library staff member remembered the existence of the book and set about trying to find someone who could crack the cipher. The math professors whom the library contacted were largely uninterested in what seemed to be more of an esoteric historical problem than a conceptual mathematic one. The library then contacted the <em>Brown Daily Herald</em> and asked it to run a piece on the book and its strange shorthand, hoping that it would pique the interest of a student. Lucas Mason-Brown, a Brown University junior concentrating in mathematics, read the article and decided to try to his hand at deciphering it.

Judging from the liberal use of longhand and pictograms, Mason-Brown decided that the cipher would require something more intuitive than the complex mathematics required to break most modern ciphers. Using only a pencil and a notebook, he first tested to see if the shorthand was a substitution cipher. In a classic substitution cipher, each letter is replaced by a corresponding letter. Substitutions are relatively easy to decipher using frequency analysis, a technique first developed by the Arab philosopher Al-Kindi in the eighth century. In frequency analysis, the relative distribution of letters or groups of letters in the cipher is compared to the distribution of these letters in the original plaintext language: in English, for example, the letter E is the most commonly used letter, so the most commonly used letter in a simple substitution would probably code for it. Although these ciphers are relatively easy to break, they are often used in letters and diaries because it is fairly uncommon to find anyone who cares enough about someone else’s ramblings and passions to run a frequency analysis on his or her journal. For this reason, and because it was the easiest place to start, Mason-Brown decided to start with a frequency analysis of the 28 characters. He copied the 28 geometric characters that seemed to be systematically repeated, known in cipher circles as the “core characters,” and ran a frequency analysis on them.

This yielded unsuccessful results. Mason-Brown’s next step was to follow the trail of the uncoded longhand scattered throughout the notes. Longhand appears often in the book, at the top of the page as a kind of topic header. When Mason-Brown saw “Netherlands, Utr,” followed by a bunch of cipher, it was obvious to him that the jottings were about Utrecht, the populous Dutch city. Furthermore, because the relative distribution of characters was atypical of general English plaintext, Mason-Brown guessed that vowels must be represented implicitly, similar to the way they are in Hebrew, or the way they are in a shorthand popularized by John Willis’s 1602 book <em>The Art of Stenographie</em>. He turned out to be right.

Williams’s method of representing vowels, which Mason-Brown describes as the “clock mechanism,” is tri-fold. If a vowel is at the beginning of a word, it is represented by a substitution of its corresponding core character. If it is in the middle of a word, it is represented implicitly by the next consonant’s position relative to the previous one. The letter A’s position is in the bottom left-hand corner of a consonant, E’s is on the middle of the lefthand side, and so on. For example, Williams would represent the word “bat” by writing a large character which stands for B with a small character which represents T in the implicit A position—the bottom left corner of the B symbol. Williams represents vowels that come at the end of words with a dot in the appropriate vowel position.

Williams omits more than just vowels; often entire syllables are left out. Florian Coulmas observes of consonant-based writing systems in his book <em>Writing Systems of the World</em>, that “cnsnt scrpts r nt s dffclt t rd s n mght thnk.” Of course, what you have just read is in typeset, not faded, messy handwriting, and all Coulmas omitted were the vowels—not entire syllables or parts of words the way Williams would for four- or five-page stretches. Words abbreviated in this way are commonly known as “defectives.” Many of Wiliams’s defectives are cartoons or pictograms: friendship is depicted by a longhand F followed by a crude drawing of a ship, and “around the world” is depicted by a dot with a circle around it—not unlike a boob drawn by a sixth grader. These fanciful aberrations are what make the translation most difficult. “In modern codes, decoding is the hardest part, and the translation is easy,” says Mason-Brown, “but this code is the opposite: he gets lazy at times, and he has really bad handwriting.”

A code this unsystematized was not primarily intended or used as a way to communicate classified information, or even to hide it forever. The code was not intended to be totally impenetrable: other more secure codes were known, such as the Vigenere cipher, which, although widely used for secret government correspondence (each iteration relies on a keyword system, so multiple governments can use different versions without being able to decipher the others’), wasn’t broken until the nineteenth century. Furthermore, John Willis’s shorthand system, on which the code is based, was the most popular system of the hundreds circulating in England at the time. And although the history of codes is filled with things like Mary Queen of Scots hiding coded letters in a beer barrel and Chinese spies swallowing scrunched balls of waxed silk, as far as we know, Williams didn’t go to great lengths to hide the book itself. Which is to say, judging from Williams’s relative laziness in hiding and encoding his work, although we can never be sure, he probably did not write in a cipher because he was an undercover agent or an Illuminati saboteur. So why did he use such a system?

Certainly part of the reason is that shorthand saves space. Mason-Brown estimates that the notes would be four or five times longer written in longhand. This was especially important in a society where the cost of paper was relatively high, and there was an ever-increasing demand for paper and writing among the rapidly increasing professional class of attorneys, clerks, and accountants. Furthermore, the use of shorthand for marginal notes and for copying out whole works or speeches rapidly gained popularity in the early 17th century. Sermons, to the great irritation of many preachers, were often copied down in shorthand and sold by independent print shops without any compensation to the original authors, who were unable to sue due to lack of copyright laws. In her book <em>Shakespeare in Shorthand</em>, Kenyon College professor Adele Davidson argues that the textual inconsistencies among the various editions of King Lear arise not from faulty memorial reconstruction, as many scholars have previously argued, but from misinterpretations of shorthand bootlegs written down by audience members. Davidson argues that shorthand should be seen as a kind of proto tape or video recorder that democratized access to information by allowing people to write about events in real time. By the mid-seventeenth century, the practice was so widespread that the Czech scholar, Jan Comenius, marveled at the “common people” who copied down sermons and speeches, and Sir Ralph Vernay, a parliamentarian who fled England during the Civil War before coming back and joining the Restoration government, expressed amazement at the “multitudes of women” doing the same.

Plus, as Mason-Brown notes, Roger Williams “probably wouldn’t have used it if it didn’t save him some time.” Before Williams’s American adventures—getting banished in 1635 after being convicted of “sedition and heresy,” moving in with a Narragansett tribe, and founding the beautiful settlement of Providence, —he apprenticed with a the London jurist, Sir Edward Coke. It was here he learned Willis’s method of shorthand, adapting it to his own style so that he could write quickly and from memory without having to translate from plaintext into shorthand. Willis endorsed freedom and flexibility in shorthand, suggesting in his book that each user adapt the system to his own purposes for enhanced speed and secrecy. John Locke suggests shorthand “both for dispatch in what men write for their own memory, and concealment of what they would not have lie open to every eye.” Indeed, Samuel Pepys, a British naval administrator and Parliament member whose famous Diary is now one of the key primary source documents of the Restoration, wrote the work in his own cipher shorthand for speed, secrecy, and what he called a “racy spontaneity.”

Because Williams’s cipher was primarily for personal use, the pictograms vary, the abbreviations are unstable, and the handwriting is often quite hard to read. Certain abbreviations are consistently used across the marginalia. Furthermore, the Rhode Island Historical society granted Mason-Brown access to some of Williams’s personal letters in order to corroborate his handwriting. Not only did Mason-Brown ascertain that the handwriting was a match he also found examples of Williams’s shorthand at the bottom of one of these letters.

•♦•♦•♦•♦•♦•♦•

The content of the first part of the mystery book’s marginalia is not especially mind-blowing—it’s an almost verbatim copy of popular preacher and polemicist Peter Heylyn’s 1652 work, <em>Cosmographie in Four Bookes</em>. Cosmographies were a popular genre at the time, combining occult mysticism, alchemy, history, and geography in an attempt to describe the entirety of the world in a single work. Heylyn’s was one of the first English-language cosmographies and was among the first books to ever mention Australia or California. The book ends with a section on “Terra Incognita,” which begins in Australia and ends with a description of a fairyland utopia. Mason-Brown says that Williams copied down the entirety of the book, but he can’t quite account for why. Part of the reason could be that Heylyn was a lecturer at Cambridge while Williams was a student or that Heylyn was an outspoken loyalist like Williams himself. The publication date of this book coincides with Williams’s second and last trip back to England from 1651-54, and suggests a reason for why he copied whole sections of it: he didn’t want to lug “Four Bookes” all the way back to the New World. Heylyn’s book was quite popular and mainstream in his England, but the focus on mythical lands and not-quite-Puritan mysticism may have been a motivation for Williams to hide his notes from prying New England neighbor eyes. Or perhaps Williams was interested in the subject matter but was just too cheap to buy a real copy.

As you hoped, Williams’s writing has a “sexy” side. As Mason-Brown puts it, “some of the stuff at the end is pretty racy,” dealing with human physiology and reproduction, with a particular emphasis on sexual dysfunction. Mason-Brown believes them to be notes from some text which he has not yet identified. The last twenty pages of notes are filled with sentences like: “But Eunuchs are also lustful. They are great lovers of women.” There are also references to sperm, abortions, and—this last category is particularly noteworthy because many believe that Roger Williams was one—hermaphrodites. Furthermore, there are fifty pages of margin notes in the middle of the book that Mason-Brown believes to be original Roger Williams writing, but which he has not yet deciphered.

Willis, citing the Italian cryptologist Baptista Della Porta, suggests that the cryptanalyst know as many languages as possible. Mason-Brown’s next project, Roger Williams’s marginalia in the leaves of the Elliot Indian Bible, makes the logic behind this suggestion clear. The Elliot Bible was the first to be published in the New World and was the first book ever to be published in Algonquin, which had been an exclusively spoken language until the Reverend John Elliot adapted it to text as part of his missionary attempt to convert the Algonquin tribe. The marginalia in this book is written in a mix of English longhand, Algonquin longhand, English shorthand, and Algonquin shorthand. When I asked Mason-Brown how he was going to deal with this, he dryly replied that he would probably have to learn some Algonquin. Considering that Williams thought the Algonquins were one of the lost tribes of Israel and that they needed to be converted before the second coming of Christ, this could reveal something very strange and interesting.

But what if it doesn’t? There is an expectation that cracking a cipher will reveal something new and secret, something sexy and nefarious. Spies and governments send messages in code. Books, movies, and television are filled with stories of plots unraveled by the cracking of a code or cipher. Just last week on <em>Gossip Girl</em>, Blair cracked a cipher which revealed that Nate’s boss/lover was actually Chuck’s mother who ran a high-class prostitution ring and at the last second wasn’t Chuck’s mother after all. Or something (it was very confusing). Codes, secrets, and plots capture our collective imagination in a way that few other things do. Having cracked Williams’s shorthand, it seems that the next step is understanding Williams’s reasoning for making it, and it seems so . . . <em>disappointing</em> to attribute it solely to concerns of time, space, expense, or convenience. But what if it was only that? So far, the weirdest thing in Roger Williams’s code is his interest in sexual dysfunction, which actually isn’t actually that weird—I’m pretty sure that everyone is interested in that. What if Roger Williams wasn’t trying to hide anything? What if the secret twist is that there is no secret twist? Why are we always trying to find one?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[by Lizzie Davis, Grace Dunham, Alexander Sammon &amp; Benson Tucker

LIKE ANY CITY worthy of the title, Providence has a long and troubled history with knives. Precision instruments among humanity’s earliest bionic adaptations, fine blades can be a point of pride. At base, knives mean power, a dangerous allure.

When the knife is used for ill, though, the result isn’t mastery so much as amateurism. In November, a knife-wielding robber wearing a skeleton mask attempted to rob a Cranston Rite Aid. The clerk repeatedly insisted that she had no money to offer. After arguing with her for a while, the would-be thief left empty-handed. A Fall River liquor store robber, blade in hand, held up the same store three times in a 24-hour period but was apprehended after the store owner realized it was the same culprit who had hit the place the year before.

Knife crimes are often both juvenile and tragic. A disproportionate number of knife crime suspects are teens. Knives are the most readily available weapons and, accordingly, they set up young trouble-makers to get in well over their heads. Two Central Falls teens, aged 18 and 15, face first degree robbery charges after a pair of attempted muggings. It’s the involvement of the knife that makes the charges first degree, a classification holding twice the prison term that the two might have faced under second degree charges.

Knives crop up as parts of a varied makeshift arsenal. In one incident in Washington Park late last year, four men armed with a knife and a crowbar approached a 19-year old passerby and robbed him of his sneakers and cell phone. The same gang may have turned up on College Hill in January, when a group fitting that description robbed a student on Brown’s campus. Here, too, teens were the culprits. The <em>Independent</em> has the inside scoop, some elements imagined, exploring knife crime, production, and miscellanea in Rhode Island.—BT

<strong>Three Inches Max</strong>

IN A RECENT RADIO BROADCAST, the ever-iconic Al Sharpton claimed that knife regulations represent the logical next step for gun control, suggesting that a society committed to minimizing violent crime must act on both fronts. Sharpton put a face to the question of knife control and crime prevention, one of few public figures to broach the issue. However, a debate over knife control cannot begin without first shedding some light on this fairly obscure legal issue. Knife control varies wildly from state to state, and what is considered kosher on one side of state lines could result in a small fine across the border. While the stakes certainly aren’t as high, the law is generally worth knowing, and Rhode Island’s knife control law is actually one of the more rewarding laws to be fluent in.

The Rhode Island state knife restriction law, Section 42 of the state code’s Weapons chapter, primarily emphasizes a limitation of blade length, in a way that is not particularly noteworthy. Rhode Islanders are entitled to both open and concealed possession of any knife up to three inches in length, from tip to handle. This posits Rhode Island as one of the least knife-friendly states in New England, second only to Massachusetts, whose tyrannical knife control provisions limit legal knives to two and a half inches, much to the chagrin of knife enthusiasts everywhere. (For comparison, New Hampshire emphatically did away with all knife regulation in 2010, creating a veritable knife-wielder’s paradise).

In the context of the gun control debate, this three inch limitation seems to best correspond to the ban of assault weapons. Without categorically illegalizing the weapons in question, Section 11-47-42 justifies limited public use of knives of excessive length or power, which can only conceivably be used to incur severe bodily harm. To borrow a line from advocates of assault rifle restriction, this law draws a hard line between what is useful and what is excessively dangerous and violent. And it seems to work--knives are only present in 22 percent of assault cases in the greater Providence area.

Yet, like so many things Rhode Island, just beneath the surface there exists a world of eccentricity that tows the line between comical and practical. Because Rhode Island’s state legislators are thorough, hard-working, and hip to the lingo of the kidz these days, they went to painstaking lengths to close any and all loopholes that could be found within the law. Urban dictionary in hand, they explicitly inscribed all small weapons that are not legal for open or concealed carry, including and not limited to those “commonly known as a blackjack, slingshot, billy, sandclub, sandbag, metal knuckles, slap glove, bludgeon, stun-gun, crossbow, dagger, dirk, stiletto, bowie knife, a sword-in-cane, or the so-called ‘Kung-Fu’ weapons.” That constitutes 16 different variants of knife-like weaponry explicitly prohibited, for those of you keeping score at home.

The wording of this statute sounds like a list of props from a Robert DeNiro movie, and perhaps raises as many questions as it answers. While it may seem perfectly logical that a family-first atmosphere like Rhode Island would not want its elderly citizens running around with swords masquerading as canes, it is unprecedented in New England’s knife law tradition to enumerate all conceivable types of small weaponry, all the way down to “so called kung-fu weapons.”

An exchange with the Providence Police Department yielded no information about the history of kung-fu style crime in Providence, but did suggest that in spite of the comical wording of section 11-47-42, it may truthfully deserve praise instead of reproach. Despite a high-visibility knife related incident in the College Hill area in recent weeks, Providence is not home to an inordinately high amount of knife violence. Knife crime in Providence has actually trended downward over the past three years, by a startling 15 percent. Furthermore, data indicate (by omission) that kung-fu style swordplay is at an all-time low in the Providence metro area, and there has been a conspicuous absence of sword-in-cane style assault. If anything, knives seem to be reasonably controlled already.

Perhaps most important is that Rhode Island’s knife control laws are quintessentially Rhode Island. Fluency in their stipulations tells just as much about legality as about the culture of the state itself. Quirkiness seems to come naturally to the union’s smallest state, and its penal codes are no different. Plenty of states limit the legal public use of knives, but only Rhode Island does it in such a way that is both laughable and laudable. —AS

		<title>NOVEL IDEA: THE RISE OF JAPAN&#039;S STORY-BY-CELLPHONE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Americans see a teenager tapping out text on her cellphone, they assume she's chatting with friends or sealing a date for the weekend. When Japanese see the same, they know they might be witnessing the birth of a bestselling novel.

<!--more-->
In the past five years, keitai, or "cellphone novels" have gone from being a laughable internet cult craze to a wildly popular mainstream phenomenon in Japan. Just over a year ago publishing companies began turning the stories, written on cellphones and uploaded to the web, into physical paperbacks. Their success has been groundbreaking: of last year's 10 bestselling novels, five were originally written on cellphones.

The keitai genre began as a hobby among a group of bloggers sharing romance stories, then grew into a national habit when website hosts developed software to facilitate the upload of text from cellphones. The serialized stories, known for their short phrases and scant plot development, have been criticized for lacking literary value. If democracy at its worst is mob rule, it's unsurprising that a democratic approach to art may produce insipid results.

Yet the keitai genre is, at least, democratic. One might interpret it as the fictional equivalent of blogging--a tech-enabled populist seizure of a medium long in control of the elites. Written in a straightforward style, keitai novels, readers say, are accessible to youth, unlike traditional Japanese literature. And the growth of a populist fiction market--governed not by editors and publishers but by readers--deserves special attention in the context of a society long known for its emphasis on tradition and hierarchy.

<strong>Cheap texts and packed trains</strong>
While internet-ready cellphones were available stateside long before the iPhone was released this past June, the Japanese market, which caters to a more tech-savvy population, has been dominated by a web-capable model, the i-Mode, since its release in early 1999. Cellphones quickly became such an invaluable social tool that the term keitai bunka, or cellphone culture, was coined to describe the youth culture of texts and emoticons. Some Japanese youths are so proficient in texting that they can type up to 100 characters per minute, equal to the speed required on a top-level word processing exam, according to the Japanese Information Network.

Cellphones are also the preferred internet browser for most Japanese youths, as PCs remain largely unaffordable. Web browsing via keitai grew when major network providers decided to offer unlimited packet messaging.

After noting a trend of story-writing on its users' blogs, one website host, Maho no i-rando, created software that permits text uploads directly from cellphones. Users began tapping out hundred-page stories in brief installments while commuting or during lunch breaks. The resultant web stories, which quickly gained millions of readers, became the first keitai shosetsu, or cellphone novels.

The stories have drawn a wide audience because they can be read, as well as written, on a cell phone screen, usually for free. And the infamously overcrowded Japanese commuter trains give keitai novels an edge over paperbacks. Almost everyone in Japan, from student to office worker, uses public transportation, and some commuters say the trains are so packed that it's impossible to open a book.

Yet keitai stories have enjoyed only increasing popularity, on and offline, since publishers picked up on the trend and started translating website hits into book sales. According to a September article in the Japan Times, the five keitai novels on the top-ten bestseller list have sold an average of 400,000 copies each. The top seller, "Love Sky," was even made into a movie.

<strong>Language democratized or language defiled?</strong>
What's so interesting about the keitai novel phenomenon is not only the medium in which they were conceived, but also the novice background their authors share. Most keitai authors have never written fiction before, and most keitai consumers are first-time readers of novels. A 21-year-old writing under the pen name Rin, for example, keyed out her opus "If You" as a high school senior, writing the story in installments over a six-month period. That story, after winning an online vote among cell readers, was turned into a 142-page book that became the number five bestseller of 2007.

And indicators suggest that the genre is not a mere flash in the pan. The Mainchi Shimbun newspaper and Starts Publishing, a leading publisher of the cellphone works, launched the Japan Keitai Novels Prize last year. In this year's competition, so far there are 2000 titles competing for a prize of ¬•2 million, or $18,700.
That five of the top-selling novels in Japan were originally written as a series of soap opera installments between classes or during train rides signals either a populist literary revolution or the defilement of the term "fiction," depending on whom you ask. Should the genre be praised for getting teens to read? Or should it be condemned for inducting them into the world of books with stories many dismiss as trash?

Given the genre's constraints and the authors' inexperience, it's hardly shocking that the stories are attacked for lacking plot, character and scene-setting details. The predictable storylines are typically tear-jerkers featuring terminally ill beaus, desperate but good-hearted prostitutes and other such standard melodrama victims. The text generally reads like either a bad romance novel or a personal diary. The novels' simple, dialogue-heavy style poses a special threat to a country that holds the purity of its language so sacred that its major newspapers regularly run articles dreading the encroachment of the English language. A passage from "To Love You Again," in which a high-school boy drags his sweetheart into an empty classroom for a chat, reads:

Kin Kon Kan Kon (sound of school bell ringing)
(space)
The school bell rang
(space)
"Sigh. We're missing class"
(space)
She said with an annoyed expression.

Yet, criticisms notwithstanding, the genre has unique value beneath its low-fidelity veneer. Keitai novels, with their short paragraphs and simple language, are much more accessible to teens than traditional Japanese novels, whose sentences tend to be long and complex.

And keitai stories not only attract young readers, they actively involve them in the writing process. Even if readers don't start churning out their own stories, websites' comment features give fans a way to help shape the next installment of their favorite stories. Readers are often more than zealous in giving authors feedback; the 27-year-old author of "What the Angel Gave me," who goes by Chaco, told the Wall Street Journal she became so popular two years ago she received 25,000 online visitors a day, most of whom eagerly piled feedback onto her posts. "I was getting only one to two hours of sleep a night," said Chaco, whose phone would ring at 4 a.m. with emails from fans. Yet Chaco owes her book's publication to such fanatics--Starts Publishing printed the novel after a fan called and begged the company to turn her favorite story into a book.

In a culture whose rigid hierarchy is ingrained into the very structure of its language--many words come in 'plain,' 'polite,' and 'humble' varieties--the idea of story by collaboration seems liberating. Though the keitai community is not necessarily one of aspiring novelists, it is one of writers, and its members have managed to reinforce the value of the shared written experience for a young generation in a way that traditional authors have not.

Conventionally, editors and publishers are involved in helping new novelists emerge. By contrast, keitai novels are written entirely without the aid of professionals, and their success depends wholly on their popularity with readers. And while keitai writers are hardly bra-burning feminists, the genre has certainly given a generation of young women an outlet for their creative energies in a society where most of them are still expected to cook for their male relatives.

<strong>Coming to America?</strong>
While English translations of keitai stories could conceivably appear on the web in the near future, it seems unlikely that the phenomenon of cell phone stories will make it to the West any time soon. Americans, even young ones, use their cell phones for non-calling functions far less than the Japanese. And the limited texting capacity of American cellphones restricts the potential for an uploading-based craze.

Still, the advent of electronic readers like Amazon's Kindle, as well as the rise of the iPhone and similarly cutting-edge models, signal a sea change in the way we are reading. And when it comes to technology, Japanese innovations have a tendency to set the curve for the rest of the industrialized world. Americans in particular have a tendency to take Japanese trends that seem silly, like turtle-bopping plumbers or dueling owners of pets called Pokemon, and turn them into national crazes of our own. There may soon come a day when, instead of buying textbooks for classes, college students will download the course book list directly onto their phone-camera-web browser-electronic readers.

And maybe, if they commute and like to write, they'll upload a few, too.

		<title>LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES: eHARMONY&#039;S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it came to smearing online dating heavyweight eHarmony, rival Chemistry.com poured the perfect poison into the public's ear: rejection. In May 2007, Chemistry.com launched their "Rejected by eHarmony" advertisements, which questions eHarmony's record of turning down 16 percent of people who take their patented personality test. The advertisements also put forward the more serious critique that the online dating site--founded by Christian Evangelist Neil Clark Warren-- matches only heterosexual couples.

<!--more-->
In the television spots, dejected singles brainstorm why eHarmony decided he or she wasn't marriage-material. The most successful ad features a man flipping casually through a dirty magazine. He shrugs, chuckles and then says, "Nope, still gay." Other reasons for rejection include experiencing occasional depression or just falling short of eHarmony's standards of a 'good person.' At the end, a rubber stamp crashes down, marking each single in red ink: "Rejected by eHarmony."
In contrast to the conservative eHarmony, Chemistry.com encourages customers to "come as they are" when approaching online love. It seems that many liberal-minded Americans are attracted to Chemistry.com's dedication to being the new open, nonjudgmental relationship site. Since releasing the campaign, Chemistry.com experienced an 80% growth rate, as reported by The New York Times. Apparently, the advertisements  have made Americans a little uncomfortable with themselves. Unlike eHarmony or Match.com commercials that appeal to the customer's romantic side, Chemistry.com exploits a consumer's underlying fear of rejection. Forget the fluff about soul mates; Chemistry.com reminded people how it feels to be left out and even alone.
Now, Chemistry.com is targeting eHarmony in print. This time, Chemistry.com imagines a world where eHarmony is the law. Folks were rejected before, but in these, they're excluded. A sign bans homosexuals from the beach in one advertisement while in another, pre-marital sex is forbidden at a local motel. The suggestion that life under eHarmony could be similar to a police state may seem a bit exaggerated. But Adam Hanft, chief executive of Hanft, Raboy and Partners, the agency responsible for Chemistry.com's aggressive campaign, argued to the Times, "By amplifying it to that level, it points out the absurdity and discriminatory nature of [eHarmony's] practices."
<strong>
Must love God</strong>
Founded in 2000 by clinical psychologist Dr. Neil Clark Warren, eHarmony is the fourth-largest online dating service, an industry that rakes in over $650 million a year. Seeking singles pay up to $59.95 a month to have eHarmony find them their next successful relationship. A self-described passionate Christian, Warren presides over the television advertisements and website as the friendly, guiding authority, causing competitors and critics to ask just how his influence over eHarmony's selection practices play out.
Before internet matchmaking was his main business, Warren wrote love and relationship books such as Catching the Rhythm of Love, Date or Soul Mate and God Said it, Don't Sweat It, which were all published by the evangelical group Focus on the Family (FotF). He even appeared frequently as a guest on FotF founder James Dobson's radio show. Although in recent years Warren has pulled away in order to appeal to a more secular market, his positions on pre-marital sex and homosexual relationships are still informed by FotF and its dedication to traditional family values.
However, Warren's evangelical background is absent in eHarmony marketing. Evidence of his Divinity degree from Princeton or his close friendship with James Dobson is nowhere in the television advertisements unless it is drowned out by all the happy couples' enthusiastic testimonies or "This Will Be an Everlasting Love." This is not to say that Warren totally obscures this aspect of his autobiography. In a 2005 Fresh Air interview with Terri Gross, Warren openly talked about coming up on the Christian side. He also emphasized that eHarmony matches people from any religion, saying, "I'm okay with anyone who says I want to build a stronger link with a person."
<strong>Science over serendipity</strong>
Like other experts from the slew of dating websites, Warren claims to have found the exact formula for mind-blowingly transcendent relationships. After 30 years as a clinical psychologist and 43 years in an "outlandishly fortunate" marriage, Warren developed the "29 dimensions of compatibility." The eHarmony team interviewed both completely happy and utterly miserable couples to develop a complicated mash-up of emotional temperament, social style, values and cognitive mode.
Warren wants to match customers not just with someone they will like, but someone who is actually like them. On eHarmony, similarity is the key to long-lasting marital bliss. In his online essay, "My Marriage and What It Means for You," he uses an extended banking metaphor to describe commitment: "Similarities are like money in the bank. Differences are like debts you owe. It's all right to have a few debts as long as you have plenty of equity in your account. Otherwise your marriage may be bankrupt at an early point." eHarmony's short-term goal may be to help singles find committed, lasting relationships on the web, but Warren sees eHarmony's long-term goal as defeating divorce.
This--perhaps FotF-inspired--dedication to the annihilation of divorce is eHarmony's reason for pinpointing bad marriage prospects and sanitizing their dating pool. 7.5 million people have taken the eHarmony test, and roughly 16 percent haven't been accepted to the site. The exact algorithm eHarmony uses is unclear, but anyone who is depressed, difficult to please or potentially lying on the test is out.
While eHarmony's more confusing sorting mechanisms are buried under their 436 questions, one distinction is clear. On the first page of the test, the only two options available are "Man seeking Woman" and "Woman seeking Man." Any other options for orientation are immediately blocked. It seems that the company shows no interest in allowing gays and lesbians access to the site. Warren claims that in his 30 years of treating couples, he never met with a homosexual couple. Therefore, he was unable to know "what exactly the dynamic is there." Standing by his statement that new research would have to be done in order to understand the principles in homosexual relationships, Warren declines the possibility of applying his 29 dimensions to homosexual couples. Despite Warren's Christian background, the only public moral statement eHarmony has released about homosexuality is that gay marriage is still illegal in some states, and they can't participate in something illegal.
<strong>Ad libs</strong>
When it comes down to it, if a customer disagrees with eHarmony's policies, they can find love elsewhere on the web. There are hundreds of dating sites in the online marketplace, like Match.com, myPartner.com and Chemistry.com, which actually cater to the needs of gay and lesbian singles. Responsibility then falls in the lap of the consumer, who has to decide whether or not to buy the product.
Like an antidote to doublespeak, Chemistry.com's "Rejected by eHarmony" advertisements soured Warren's promises of electric, long-lasting compatibility. That pesky kernel of doubt, responsible for ruining reputations and careers alike, was planted. Even if the customer isn't homosexual or wasn't part of the 16 percent already rejected, the warm welcoming from Neil Clark Warren now sounds not only corny, but also canned. By positioning themselves as the alternative to narrow-minded and old-fashioned eHarmony, Chemistry.com appeals to individuals who have been excluded and who want to be inclusive.

		<title>DISPATCHES FROM DES MOINES: IGNORING THE FINE PRINT OF RON PAUL&#039;S CAMPAIGN</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>An Elevator as an Apt Metaphor </strong>
The day before the first caucus, a young Iowan pseudo-goth waited for the elevator outside Ron Paul's campaign headquarters in Des Moines. As the down arrow lit up, a girl came from nowhere, pouncing on him.

<!--more-->
"You caucusing tomorrow?" she asked.
"I don't know."
"You know Ron Paul wants all troops out of Iraq imm-ed-i-ately."
"Oh yeah?"
"And look." She handed him a brochure. "Paul wants to limit the government's control over our lives."
He stepped into the elevator nodding at the card. She followed him. So did I.
"Oh," he said, noticing the word "conservative" after the bolded "constitutional." "He's a Republican?"
"He's a Libertarian. It's conservative in the sense that..." She went on about small government and the troops in Iraq. She threw in something about stopping the IRS from "knocking down our doors."
He said he was raised a Democrat. He was just stopping by to see a friend.
"Plenty of Democrats have voted Paul. Now's the time for a President to end the war and free us from the system. The talk must stop. It's time to act."
He smiled. I winced. He ignored me. The elevator came to a stop.
"I like what he stands for," he said. And then, "I like this guy."
This incident was catchphrase marketing at its politicized best. Ron Paul will end the war. Ron Paul will keep your doors from being knocked down by bionic accountants. All conveyed in less time than it takes a teakettle to boil. The efficacy of the pitch and its reception by this one voter represents the route from ear-catching slogans to acceptance of a whole package-deal--a route that has proven improbably effective in bringing this fringe candidate out of obscurity. Events in Iowa make clear that Paul's success in garnering support, cash and primary votes comes largely from his ability to campaign under certain voguish and attractive banners--Return to Constitutionalism, Small Government, Anti-Interventionist--while upholding a radical and often contradictory agenda. Throughout a day among Ron Paul's volunteers, supporters and the Congressman himself, I found myself swept into a strange current of dogmatism that never seemed to lead to a consistent goal.
Which isn't to say that Ron Paul is unique in inspiring a blind faith in his supporters. At Barack Obama's New Year's Day rally in Des Moines, hundreds of Barackettes shrieked and clapped when Obama waved to the banner behind him and told us, "It's what we need: Change." Any effort on my part to engage other audience members in a discussion of the issues at hand would inevitably meet with the fiery affirmation that "it's time for change" and very little more. That Obama's most enthusiastic supporters might not be able to draw up a cost-benefit analysis of his healthcare policy reform proposal isn't quite the same, though, as Ron Paul's supporters' trusting the contract without pouring over the fine print. These Obama fans merely parrot the Change idea to express a vaguely defined political paradigm shift that has (almost entirely) to do with party affiliation. Paul's supporters have principled disagreements with mainstream ideas and practices, but a day among them in Iowa gave the impression that many trusted Paul to deliver on grand, sweeping, philosophical issues while largely unaware of or uninterested in specific consequences of the Paul agenda.
<strong>BUYER BEWARE </strong>
At 7:00 Caucus eve, 600 people gathered in the grand ballroom of the Hotel Fort Des Moines for a Ron Paul event called "A Stronger America Rally." I approached a couple surrounded by their seven well-behaved young children. After the wife talked a bit about the family's dairy farm and the home-school she runs from her kitchen table, conversation moved to Ron Paul's plan to dismantle the Department of Education. Both thought it was a good way to limit government influence over American lives, but they gave tellingly different answers as to what would happen to children without public schools. "They'll all be home-schooled," said the wife, at which point her husband piped in, "The church will look out for them."
When a reporter asked an elderly couple why they supported Ron Paul, the husband mentioned Paul's veteran-friendly policies, such as employer tax credits for hiring veterans and allowing veterans to receive both disability and retirement pay. When the two were asked if they supported Paul's plan to abolish Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the wife shook her head and said, "I don't know about that." It's the same selective voting that allowed Ron Paul to hold a Congressional seat representing Texas' Gulf Coast counties while opposing FEMA relief.
<strong>A Gathering Storm </strong>
While it is unlikely that he will win the Republican nomination, Ron Paul's popularity has mounted in the past month. Although he finished fifth in Iowa, earning only 10 percent of the vote, he received nearly 8,000 more votes than Rudy Giuliani. In New Hampshire, Paul again placed fifth but managed to elbow out Fred Thompson, earning 18,303 votes to Thompson's candidacy-ending 2,886. Paul rose to fourth place in Michigan and took second place in Nevada--by far his campaign's greatest coup.
Paul's finances reflect a frenzy among his supporters that isn't apparent from his standing in the polls. As of December 31, Ron Paul had raised $19,765,974 in the fourth quarter of his campaign, bringing him to roughly $28 million total. These donations came from 130,000 donors, including over 100,000 new contributors, and gave Paul more money than any other Republican candidate in the final quarter.
On November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, Ron Paul broke fundraising records when supporters spread a viral Youtube video that associated Fawkes's anti-authoritarianism and the film V for Vendetta with Congressman Paul. "Remember, remember the fifth of November!" chanted the clip, and donors remembered handsomely. That day, Paul raised $4.2 million in online contributions from more than 37,000 donors. His backers again used historical acts of revolution to resonate with their cause when on December 16, 2007, the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, he raised just over $6 million--more than any single day fundraising total in campaign history. He has raised more money from more people than any other candidate, all with a much lower average donation amount.
<strong>The Congressman Inspires Hope, Expletives </strong>
There would be little merit in arguing that shrewd or duplicitous marketing is all that convinces PayPal-accessing voters and teenagers in elevators to unknowingly embrace a candidate who plans to abolish Welfare, Medicare, Social Security, The Department of Education, The Department of Health and any governmental agencies who combat global warming and preserve the environment; dismantle FEMA; overturn Roe v. Wade; leave the UN; and return the currency system to the gold standard.
Rather, it seems that Paul's relative success can be attributed to a voting base that is easily marketed to. It's less the cynical campaigning of the candidate than the disillusionment of his society and its readiness for a revolutionary re-thinking of the system. In a race in which candidates peddle the notion of Change, Ron Paul promises total upheaval. His campaign slogan is the word "Revolution," and considering the scope of his grievances and the rebellious pitch of the Americans he inspires, the term is hardly an exaggeration.
"Why do you support Ron Paul?" I asked one young volunteer on the street outside Paul HQ. "The way shit is," he said, "how could I not?" According to a CNN entrance poll from the Iowa Caucus, of the voters who answered they felt angry about the Bush administration, more voted for Ron Paul than for all the other Republican candidates combined. Frank Luntz said it best in a November 1, 2007 Time Magazine article: "His supporters are the equivalent of crabgrass. It's not the grass you want, and it spreads faster than the real stuff. They just like him because he's the most anti-Establishment of all the candidates, the most likely to look at the camera during the debates and say, 'Hey, Washington, f[uck] you.'"
And though Paul inspires vehement support, he pulls it off without off-putting Deaniac rage. Dr. Ron Paul seems to be more of a principled ideologue than a Capitol Hill shark, a novelty in this arena. Almost a throwback. In person, the man is Pixar's grandfatherly chess player in a power suit. He addresses reporters with the ease of a man who doesn't need a handler or focus team to tell him how he should answer a question.
His best selling points come from his internally consistent doctrine. Ron Paul doesn't want to end the war to appease a party base or cater to polls, but because he doesn't believe it's the government's role to be in Iraq. Or anywhere else, for that matter. In keeping true to his laissez-utterly-faire theory, Paul wants the US to withdraw all military forces from all international bases. Everywhere. In the same way that Mike Huckabee represents a return to populist love-thy-(American, Christian)neighbor Republicanism, Ron Paul promises to find the Hamiltonian small-government conservatism that's been reduced to rubble under the current administration's executive over-reaching.
This Ron Paul, the Champion of Laissez-Faire Constitutionalism, found a welcome audience at his January 2 rally. Phil, an Air Force Reserve from Missouri who came to Iowa as a student volunteer for Paul, was surrounded by a cluster of head-nodding people when he said, "[Paul] follows the Constitution. The president has to go to Congress to declare war. That's the way it's set up to be, and that's the way it should be. And if we followed that policy, I think we'd have a better world for our country and all countries around the world."
But Paul's immigration policy, no small pillar of his candidacy, comes in direct conflict with the Constitution. While the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to all people born in the United States, regardless of their parents' citizenship standing, border state congressman Ron Paul would deny citizenship to any child born to an illegal immigrant mother. This is a telling example of the larger issue of Paul lovers loving despite policy that goes directly against what they profess to love.
<strong>Our Flag is Still There </strong>
By 7:30 on the night before the caucus in the grand ballroom at the Hotel Fort Des Moines, the audience had taken their seats and the press had focused their cameras toward a podium under a gigantic American flag. The chandeliers dimmed, and attention was directed to large screens showing a documentary about the Revolutionary War battle at Fort McHenry. When the narrator explained that the Revolutionary Guard's stamina came from "the knowledge that good Christian men would rather die on their feet than live on their knees," some rose to their feet in applause.
When a former POW led the country in the pledge of allegiance, the man next to me said "under God" several decibels louder than the preceding lines and veritably shouted "Liberty and Justice for all." Here we were, unfairly taxed by a latter-day King George, ready to fight for an America that deserves better.
Paul began his address with this: "What makes me so excited about this is that we're philosophically oriented. We believe in something. We believe in something worth fighting for." Hundreds of heads nodded, and "we" were left to project our beliefs, our hundreds of separate beliefs, onto some glorious fight.

		<title>FROM SERBIA WITH LOVE: ON KANVASSING, KAFANAS AND KOSOVO</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At a stoplight on the bustling commercial boulevard of Knez Mihailova in downtown Belgrade, a group of Serbian Democratic Party (SDP) legionnaires are planted at a booth, wrapped up to the nines, braving the unusual subzero winter. Doggedly, they hand out party manifestos emblazoned with the uninspired choice of incumbent President Boris Tadic's craggy face and the pan-Slavic blue, red and white tricolor of the Serbian flag.

<!--more-->
Just a stone's throw from the canvassing, Ivana, 21, a Serbian citizen who is Montenegrin by birth, sits in the company of university friends in a nearby coffee shop. "Everyone knows no one will speak to Serbia again if Nikolic comes in," she offers matter-of-factly. It's all too apt that she dismisses ultra-nationalist hard-liner Tomislav Nikolic, the Serbian Radical Party (SRP) candidate in this month's presidential election, as she and her chums sip traditional hibiscus tea and chain-smoke.
Having yet to be integrated into the European Union (EU), the country can trust that it is a long way from being subjected to the tobacco-bashing EU directives already championed in Europe. With Serbia as one of the last European bastions of public smoking, hearty smoke-filled Serbian kafanas serve as unlikely barometers of Serbia's international seclusion, especially from EU membership--precisely the issue that dominates this month's election. In typically pussyfooting fashion, the EU has only this week offered to relax its trade and travel relations with Serbia with an agreement to be signed on February 7, just as the Russians have sealed a deal with what's left of the Southern Slavs.
<strong>Eurovision meets Tunnelvision</strong>
If pro-Russian Euroskeptic Nikolic has his way, the most pan-Euro action Serbia's getting this year will be its hosting, in May, of the annual Eurovision Song Contest--often an unintentionally comical affair famed across Europe for introducing ABBA to the world stage. According to the January 24 issue of The Economist, Nikolic secured a massive 40 percent of the 61 percent voter turnout in the first of two rounds of presidential voting cast on January 20. Fortunately for the pro-Western Tadic lobby, the leading two candidates go through to a second and final round of voting on February 3. If the outcome of the 2004 presidential election is any clue, Mr. Tadic will be pulling out all the stops--although Tadic was burnt by Nikolic in the first round that year, he handily defeated him in the second.
But with Tadic having already pulled a fast one on the Nikolic camp by securing a $500 million deal with Russian energy giant Gazprom in the current inter-round period, the February 3 electoral outcome is still murky. As a demonstration of Russian soft power, the Gazprom agreement now practically guarantees support to Serbia in its fight to prevent the UN protectorate of Kosovo from breaking away. In recent years, a triad of forces have packed a punch for Russo-Serbian affinity: both countries face separatist movements in the respective regions of Chechnya and Kosovo, both are struggling to curb these moves for independence and both believe these movements are backed by regional countries lending their political and financial support.
But for Nikolic supporters such as Nikolas, 22, a student in the Faculty of Law at University of Belgrade, the Gazprom deal is another instance of political theatrics. The deal had been in the pipeline since last year, but only now that stakes are high has it been cemented. "You see that man there, that's our new president," he says, nodding towards a billboard promoting Nikolic's election.
Nikolas, for one, whose story is a familiar one in Belgrade but rarely acknowledged in the Western European press, will be hard-pressed to switch voting gears so easily. As a 10-year-old boy in 1995, he and his family were among the Serbs forced to flee Croatia during the birthing pains of the then-Yugoslavian territory's move for independence from the Serbian-dominated union. While Human Rights Watch has persistently reported human rights abuses committed towards minorities by the Serbian authorities, it has also kept record of the plight of displaced Serbs. According to the organization, Serbian refugees from Croatia between 1991 and 1995 total 350,000 and only 120,000 have returned.
Having lived in Belgrade ever since, Nikolas remains unfazed by the fact that the SRP's official party leader, Vojislav Seselj, currently stands on trial at the International Criminal Court in the Hague for alleged crimes against humanity committed during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. Rather, concerned that a reelection would mean the flight of more Serbs from Kosovo--which has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority--Nikolas will be casting his vote decisively for rival Nikolic, the acting head of the SRP.
<strong>Kosovo: no man's land? </strong>
The hot fuss of this year's balloting is that it is the first Serbian presidential election since all other territories of former Yugoslavia--Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Montenegro--broke away from the union. It is also the first since the news, bittersweet for Serbs, of the death of former President Slobodan Milosevic while on trial at the Hague in 2006 for alleged war crimes committed in Kosovo.
The instability of this turbulent political scene, paired with the fact that the Serbian President holds the position of Commander-in-Chief, brought on a motley lineup of candidates in the initial presidential bid. The hurdles in the presidential bid are less than discriminating--a visual artist, a psychologist and an evidently deluded former heroin addict all stepped up to the plate in the first round to unseat Boris Tadic. Moreover, the UN protectorate of Kosovo is set to declare independence from Serbia just as soon as its new Prime Minister, Hashim Thaci, an ethnic Albanian and veteran of the Kosovo Liberation Army, gets a glimpse of the new Serbian premier. In the meantime, Western press reports from The Los Angeles Times to Der Spiegel continue to fuel the fire by reporting that the issue of Kosovo's sovereignty looms over this month's election. In reality, the belief that Kosovo must not secede from Serbia is the only issue that has united the presidential contenders, including the seven eliminated by the results of the first round. When Serbs vote on Sunday, they will be voting for the means through which Serbia can retain Kosovo, not for whether it will.
<strong>Rehashing the red, white and blue</strong>
In 1999, when NATO bombed Belgrade in response to President Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian guerillas in Kosovo, The New York Times quoted the ambivalent sentiments of Milanko Zablacanski. Formerly an acclaimed Serbian actor, Zablacanski had previously quit his job on state-owned television to become politically active against Milosevic's domestic policies. "I have to support Milosevic now," he said. "All the protests are now absolutely unimportant because the West is soon to bomb my country... The West has no idea what Kosovo means to the Serbian people... If the Scottish people wanted to separate from the United Kingdom, would the West bomb to help Scotland become independent?"
It is not a coincidence that the most prominent billboards in Belgrade are either presidential campaign ads or those of the Serbian Ministry of Kosovo's enterprising "Kosovo is Serbia!" campaign. The current propaganda inventively uses the singular faces and quotes of prominent dead American and Western European politicians, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Winston Churchill and Willie Brandt, in support of the notion that Kosovo must not secede. One particular advertisement found on a public transport bus features the bust of Abraham Lincoln with a quotation written in the Cyrillic alphabet set against the American flag. It is polished off with the Serbian Ministry of Kosovo's own clarion call. Translated, it reads: "'In most important things we cannot and must not give in!'--Kosovo is Serbia!"
The billboards can be found the length and breadth of Serbian highways, on buses and in publications. With a suitably nonplussed tone, The International Herald Tribune picked up on the story back in December. Dragoslav Bokan, director of Arts and Crafts, the advertising agency charged by the Serbian government to undertake the campaign, told the Tribune, "We are trying to remind people that there are Western politicians who say it is all right to defend your state." It is peculiar that the campaign targets the very people who don't need proselytizing when it is the international community that the Serbians must convince most.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: ON FICTIONAL POLITICIANS AND THEIR REAL-WORLD EFFECTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The difference between Aaron Sorkin and Jon Favreau (not the actor) is, in a way, slight. As speechwriters, both tend toward chiasmic turns of phrase, momentum-gathering lists of hopeful things that come in pairs and sudden injections of personal anecdotes into lengthy policy proposals.

<!--more-->
Both men bandy about the word "hope"; both men's penchant for parallel structure is, well, unparalleled. But while Sorkin created and wrote hyper-witty political dramas such as NBC's The West Wing and the Rob Reiner-directed The American President, Favreau has been head speechwriter for Barack Obama since the points he made for John Kerry's campaign became moot in 2004. That is, the former deals in fictional characters, the latter in actual candidates.
Such a distinction, however, made by pundits and partisans of American politics--that Obama is a real candidate and Sorkin's creations are not--is less exact, less definitive, less convincing on another level: in the minds of the American public. The fictional alternate realities created by political dramatists like Sorkin draw in and deeply affect viewers who are, at the same time, voters.
<strong>
The wind beneath West Wing</strong>
Eight years ago, during America's last incumbent-less presidential campaign, The West Wing was starting a run of immense popularity and critical acclaim. The show won a record-breaking number of Emmys for its 1999-2000 season, including Best Drama--an impressive achievement when considering its patchwork lineage.
Sorkin's The American President featured Michael Douglas as well-intentioned left-centrist President Shepard. In a climax showcasing Sorkin's speechwriting flourish, President Shepard makes a tough call look morally justified, a choice influenced by his chief of staff--played by one Martin Sheen. And Sorkin had already penned two seasons of Sports Night, which either inspired or irritated viewers by taking its own smarmy banter incredibly (arguably, far too) seriously.
The West Wing played on the successes of these two predecessors. The American President's cutting room floor featured President Shepard's left-leaning, hard-working senior staff at work, and Sorkin translated these secondary storylines to television by using many of the characters and basic plots sketched out by Sports Night's ensemble cast. Sheen was promoted from Chief of Staff to President Josiah Bartlet. The show was to have the smart teleplay of Sports Night in the framework of the feel-good politics (if you were a Democrat, that is) of The American President. Content and context to befit one another.
This was during the end of the Clinton administration, at the tail end of the Lewinsky scandal. Morals, personality and family values rose to the top of the nation's concerns, and Bill Clinton's charm was no longer enough. In the thick of the 2000 presidential race, NBC began running an ad campaign for The West Wing that announced that the show featured "a president we can all agree on." As essayist Chris Lehmann explained in a 2001 issue of The Atlantic, "Bartlet [is] a two-dimensional glyph of implausible virtue. He is charismatic and quietly omnicompetent, √† la Bill Clinton, but viewers are forcefully reminded that he does not share Clinton's (or John F. Kennedy's) priapic weaknesses."
<strong>A passionate apathy, an active passivism</strong>
For millions of West Wing fans--myself included--to inhabit the world of Bartlet's White House was to live in a kind of dream America: one of hope and progress, where one could believe in a Commander in Chief who was decisive but thoughtful, who drew from a copious knowledge of Latin, world history and economics. His flaws were forgivable: he lied about a degenerative illness (multiple sclerosis), but it was not fatal and not debilitative. He smoked a cigarette when times got tough, but rarely and somehow meaningfully.
In August of 2000, CNN ran a poll connected to an article about how West Wing fans would vote in the November election. Thirty-two percent of the 9,000 respondents said they would punch in chads for President Bartlet, 27 for Gore, 25 for Bush. There was only one problem: voting for Bartlet would have been tantamount to writing in for Mickey Mouse; he was a character, not a candidate.
But the vote nevertheless expressed a political affinity and opinion. So palpably felt was the desire for Sheen's character to be the real president--so strongly did viewers wish to color in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with a creation from Sorkin's pen--that citizens who believed in this fictional President were more inclined to back him in a hypothetical campaign than translate their empathies to a corporeal counterpart.
The problem for liberal fans of The West Wing was most evident in the 2000 campaign. As Laura Lippman outlined in a New York Times essay from December of that year, the show "makes a counterproductive pact with its almost 20 million viewers: stay home, surrender to this fantasy of a Democratic president who never abandons his principles and skip the real thing." Lippman's point stems from the same logic as Lehmann's: that Bartlet, as a fictional character, is a hodgepodge of ideal qualities unattainable by real Democratic candidates, a creation born from our deepest desires to which no reality--certainly not Gore then or Kerry in 2004--could come close in comparison.
Beyond the candidate comparisons, the effect of The West Wing fanaticism runs deep into the political psyche. From the comfort of your own home, you could watch these staffers actually alter the course of the world. The scope was so large--and the successes or failures so monumental when coming from the White House--that instead of calling viewers to action on the issues, the show often generated a sort of lazy activism. You need not go fight for these issues; watch the next episode, in which they resolve them. From The West Wing, one former fanatic told the Independent, comes a kind of "political hormone replacement."
Not that the actors haven't continually tried to connect the fictional world of The West Wing to the real elections American voters face. Earlier this month, as Sheen campaigned with Bill Richardson in Iowa, Robert Schiff (Communications Director Ziegler) stumped for Joe Biden. Bradley Whitford (Debuty Chief of Staff Josh Lyman) has recorded videos and written for liberal site No More Dirty Tricks. The mixed success of these candidates highlights the trouble with translating The West Wing's principled interplay into any kind of realpolitik.
<strong>Searching for Bauer's fiction</strong>
The television politics of today, though less dominated by The West Wing, are still ideologically central. In a May 2007 debate among Republican presidential candidates at the University of South Carolina, the name Jack Bauer was on the lips of more than one White House hopeful. Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland's terrorist-hunter on 24, is constantly under fire in the series for using torture to get answers from a terrorist--in order, as is his raison d'etre, to save America and the rest of the free world.
When asked how he would interrogate terror suspects, Colorado Representative Tom Tancredo answered decisively: "I'm looking for Jack Bauer at that time, let me tell you," more than insinuating that his modus operandi would be less Bartlet than Rambo.
A super-Realist in a fictional world, Bauer provides a helpful ally for candidates looking for the resolute man-of-action image cultivated and employed by the Bush administration. Though only Tancredo mentioned the character by name, other debaters capitalized on the kind of rhetoric fans of 24 would recognize.
On a watchdog blog run by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, Mary Curtis worried about 24's effect on political discourse. She reported that a delegation, which included the dean of the US Military Academy as well as FBI interrogators, asked 24's producers to stop its "glamorous torture tableaux" as they left them with "the training of American soldiers who want to be just like him."
Democrats, too, have been called on to respond to the world portrayed by 24. In an October 2007 Meet the Press appearance, former President Bill Clinton said he would authorize torture if a situation like those seen on 24 presented itself. Later, he all but repealed his comment, saying that "a policy which legitimizes this, it's a slippery slope and you get in the kind of trouble we've been in here with Abu Ghraib, with Guantanamo." Senator Hillary Clinton disagreed with her husband's initial Bauer-approval, arguing that the United States must not allow torture under any circumstances.
<strong>In the land of the Real, the television is President</strong>
For politicians and public figures like the Clintons, debating the merits of fictional characters and situations seems a matter of illuminating fact with fiction. 24 provides hypothetical situations against which decisions that might actually occur may be examined. Fiction, as we're so often told, could help us to understand better the lives we live and the choices we make.
But the direction of these connecting lines refracts in the television's glare; art that imitates political life is not just dependent on real world politics. Rather, as politicians like Tancredo and the Clintons bring television characters into political discourse--when we pretend that Jack Bauer and Jed Bartlet exist in worlds operating on the same logic as our own--the metaphor of fiction as an external mirror breaks down. American viewers and voters not only recognize how characters are inspired by real politicians, but also look for real politicians to become more like those characters. Or, as with many West Wing fans, we begin to abandon hope of that chance.
That televised worlds visualize possibilities beyond what is likely to happen tomorrow allows us to imagine and hope, as well as fear and react. But we can't pretend our reactions and television allegiances are without consequence. Some of our beliefs and votes may be based on Washington executives and others on Hollywood's portrayal of them, and from the vantage point of couches across America, a separation in spirit isn't quite so simple.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I told the friend who called me on the evening of Tuesday, January 22, to calm down, talk slower--who was dead? "Heath Ledger!" "What!" I repeated the name in shock: "Heath Ledger's dead?" The four girls seated in a circle on the floor of my room gasped collectively, staring around at each other, and repeated the words themselves, simultaneously denying and affirming the unbelievable truth. Meanwhile, the friend on the phone poured out her grief at the loss of the man she believed should have been her husband. When I relayed the news to another female friend minutes later, her first reaction was, "No! My husband!"

<!--more-->
It is a rare actor who can maintain the fervent adoration of innumerable teenage girls while earning critical accolades for inhabiting the role of an emotionally tortured gay cowboy, but such an actor was Heath Ledger. The Australian who broke into Hollywood with such films as 1999's 10 Things I Hate About You and 2001's A Knight's Tale was notoriously wary of allowing himself to be narrowly defined as a hunky blond heartthrob and chose his later roles accordingly, from a stalwart soldier in 2000's The Patriot to the lovelorn ranch hand that earned him an Oscar nomination for 2005's Brokeback Mountain. Always uncomfortable with his celebrity, Ledger eschewed the public partying and dramatic hijinks that characterize young Hollywood today, remaining more concerned with maintaining his personal and professional integrity under the pressures of fame and media scrutiny.
But could that private manner have masked a life of inner turmoil?  Do the mysterious phone calls that Ledger's masseuse Diana Wolozin made to Mary-Kate Olsen upon finding the actor unconscious indicate foul play? A drug addiction? A secret prostitution ring? Reports have surfaced that Ledger was worried about losing custody of Matilda, his two-year-old daughter with ex-fianc√© Michelle Williams--what was Williams afraid of? Some are eager to conclude that the sleeping trouble Ledger admitted to in a New York Times interview this past fall was due to, oh, I don't know, the racket from the drug- and anxiety-induced visions of Minnie Mouse that danced around the actor's darkened bedroom.  The question on the lips of every reporter, blogger and woman of marriageable age is this: was there a dark agony behind Heath Ledger's high-class professionalism and charming grin?
It's easy to compare Ledger to the likes of James Dean, River Phoenix, Kurt Cobain and Jeff Buckley. Phoenix collapsed outside legendary nightclub the Viper Room; Buckley drowned during a nighttime swim in a tributary of the Mississippi, and many are eager to ascribe a similarly dramatic tale to Ledger's last hours. But Ledger's death, like his life, was decidedly un-flashy; he died alone, quietly, after spending the previous day dining by himself and going grocery shopping, People magazine reports. According to The Associated Press, authorities were alerted on Tuesday afternoon when Wolozin, who had come to Ledger's Manhattan apartment for a scheduled appointment, was unable to wake the actor up. The cause of death is yet undetermined; an autopsy was inconclusive, and toxicology tests will not be complete for over a week. Police found a number of prescription drugs, including sleep aids, in the apartment, but there was no overt evidence of suicide or foul play. Christopher Plummer, who shot scenes with Ledger for director Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus just two days before the actor's death, told Entertainment Weekly that, aside from trouble sleeping and an illness that may have been pneumonia, Ledger had been in good spirits; when asked about initial rumors of suicide, Plummer said, "that doesn't make any sense."
The same consumers who ate Ledger up as their imaginary lover or tragic hero want to make his death their own as well, and it's inevitable that, come summer, audiences will read years of pain into the white-faced Joker that Ledger is set to portray in Batman Begins sequel The Dark Knight. We want to see, understand and sympathize with Ledger, but to insist on dramatic closure misses the point of the life we mourn.
According to MTV.com, Ledger nurtured a self-professed obsession with the folk singer Nick Drake, who died at 26 from an apparent drug overdose. Last year, Ledger directed and starred in a short video clip that was shown at two exhibits devoted to Drake, and though it has not been publicized, a representative for Drake's estate calls the clip, in which Ledger simulates drowning himself in a bathtub, "gorgeous" and "extremely moving."
Whether the clip reveals anything about Ledger's own psyche and the possible reasons for his death is unclear and ultimately unimportant; what it demonstrates is Ledger's ability to transform anything--even death--into something beautiful and meaningful. It is that same ability that made him something to everyone, whether a rallying point for gay rights activists or the model of the perfect husband. Ledger will be remembered for his commitment to character, for his bold career choices, for that smile, but most of all for his way of bringing out the soul of something for each of us to recognize and love as our own.

		<title>A SPOONFUL OF SCRIPTURE: CANDY SHOPPING IN JERUSALEM</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there a direct relationship between piety and sugar consumption? I was in Jerusalem and I never saw so much candy. Candy in the Muslim quarter, candy in the Jewish quarter, candy in the Christian quarter. Tourists are not allowed in the Armenian quarter, but there is probably candy there too. Next to the yarmulkes are bins of liquid-filled grape suckers. Beside the keffiyehs are jelly blocks of Turkish Delight. The tea is so sweet it makes my teeth chatter. I used a pen to stir my morning tea and by the afternoon it was stickier than flypaper and covered in lint.

<!--more-->
Me'a She'arim is the Orthodox Jewish section of Jerusalem. It is an interesting place to visit but not a fun place to be. There are forbidding signs posted in the streets: "Please Do Not Pass Through Our Neighborhood in Immodest Clothes," and on the doors: "Please Enter My Store in Modest Clothing." Religious solemnity feels a lot like hostility when it means that no one will look you in the eye except to glare. The men wear black hats, the women wear black stockings, and everyone is shaped like a matzoh ball, except for the skinny and hyperactive kids.
Despite narrow sidewalks and heavy traffic, the kids are moving fast, zooming around with curly earlocks flying. They are tanked up on sugar, or about to be tanked up on sugar. Candy stores are hard to miss in Jerusalem. They are everywhere, selling long pipes of taffy and bulging sacks of intricate sugary wheels. There are bags of dates and blocks of halvah solid enough to build a temple out of.
The loose candy is displayed in overflowing bins or jumbled up on tables. Most of them are warped but recognizable versions of familiar candies, but there are plenty that would make fine objects of study for the culinary anthropologist. Turkish Delight is a pinkish substance that tastes like a rose-flavored jellyfish. Sometimes it is flavored with walnuts, cinnamon, lemon or orange, but it is always dusted with sugar and stacked into terraced structures. So much glucose in so many guises.
Israelis even eat bowls of fruit jelly for dessert, as though toast were too much of an impediment to bother with. They scrape up the jelly with little spoons and wash it down with cold water. For the festival of Sukkot, a weeklong holiday, Jews each year construct small huts in homage to those their ancestors built after the exodus from Egypt. Some Orthodox Jews choose to live in these huts during the festival. In Jerusalem this past year, a giant hut, or sukkah, was constructed out of candy in a major plaza. Inside stood a jumbo chocolate fountain, several cotton candy machines and candy banks that dispensed jelly beans and bubblegum to thousands of small children. The mayor of the city operated the fountain, dipping marshmallows in the goo and handing them out. City officials estimated that two tons of candy were distributed throughout the holiday.
One of the stranger sweets to be found in Jerusalem is a pastry called knafeh. You can locate knafeh in every bakery being pulled from the oven on hot, round trays. It is doused in sugar syrup and sliced into bright orange squares. A layer of white cheese the texture of calamari is topped with ground pistachios, syrup, and a grain that feels like gravel but is actually semolina. Knafeh is a specialty of the region, and it is very good.
On an ordinary day in Jerusalem you can observe Orthodox Jews standing around in head-to-toe black, filling plastic sacks with pizza-shaped gummies and chocolate stars--a few light snacks for blistering hours of religious study. It appears as though these pious men and women have outsourced every speck of color from their lives into the candy stands only to buy it all back and fill themselves up with it. Or perhaps it is merely the flame of religious conviction acting as a furnace, demanding for fuel so many hundreds of fudgy calories.

		<title>IN NEED OF NEW BLOOD: WHEN IT COMES TO DONOR DISCRIMINATION, BLAME THE FEDS by Robert Moor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Staring up into the dusty rafters of Brown's Sayles Hall, I lie on my back and feel the blood drain out of me. It coils down into a plastic bag, which gets refrigerated, spun, separated, tested for pathogens and then doled out to patients in need of a transfusion. It is an act of beautiful simplicity: we open our veins and give of ourselves so that others may live.

<!--more-->
As businesses that deal primarily in the currency of human altruism, blood centers worldwide must take precautions to keep from turning off potential donors.
Unfortunately, this is precisely what happens every week in towns across America as potential donors encounter the crudely worded "donor eligibility survey," which screens out donors who are demographically at higher risk for certain blood-born diseases, particularly malaria, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS. Among those patients "deferred indefinitely" by the survey are certain West African citizens, British residents, people who have spent more than 3 days in jail and any man who has had sex with another man, "even once, since 1977."  Since all donated blood is tested for all blood-born diseases anyway, many believe that this screening process is redundant and in need of revamping. More damningly, some allege that the process unfairly discriminates against gay and bisexual males.
However valid, these arguments tend to overlook a subtler point: broad demographic-based statistics are misleading when applied to donor groups, because the donor population is not the same as the general public. For example, while male homosexuals are 60 times more likely to test positive for HIV/AIDS than the average citizen, they are also more likely to have already been tested in the past. The likelihood of a gay male donor having HIV is thus lower than that of an average gay man; the donor pool is to a large extent self-screening.
The net result of the FDA's policy is that it ends up blindly screening out a huge quantity of healthy, clean blood--blood that could be saving lives. Moreover, since the test relies upon what is essentially the honor system, if a donor from Nigeria wants to donate blood, there is no reason he can't simply lie and say he's from Kenya, or even from Iceland. That the survey has no safeguard against such deception indicates that the ban on West Africans is not a matter of absolute necessity. In truth, the donor screening procedure is a relic of the FDA's panicked response to the AIDS scare of the early 1980's-- a time before the invention of blood testing--and has persisted more out of fear than prudence ever since. It is high time for the entire practice to be rethought.
<strong>
"Blood is a drug"	</strong>
One of the first things Jeanne Egan tries to impress upon me is that, according to the FDA, blood is considered a drug to be used for medical purposes. The second thing she makes clear is that the FDA is very, very stringent about regulating drugs. Jeanne is the Quality Assurance Manager for Donor Services at the Rhode Island Blood Center (RIBC), which coordinates all the state's blood drives. Unlike other states, whose blood donation services are handled by the Red Cross, Rhode Island's blood drives are managed by a relatively small, community-run blood center. When I sat down with Jeanne to discuss the screening criteria, I was struck by the sharp distinction between the roles of RIBC and the FDA. While RIBC alone is in charge of every level of the blood drawing process from vein-to-vein, the FDA writes the safety protocol. Each month the FDA issues a pamphlet of "guidances," densely worded instructions detailing exactly how blood should be drawn, stored, tested and transported. It is from these FDA guidances that the donor eligibility survey is culled.
Kathleen Connolly, who has been with RIBC since its inception in 1979, has watched the number of questions swell from somewhere around 20 in the early 1980s to its current 42 questions and sub-questions.  She remarked that the FDA frequently adds questions, but very rarely removes them. There are some notable exceptions, however. During the 1980s, no person with a tattoo of any kind could give blood. This regulation changed when the state of Rhode Island (at the behest of RIBC) filed for a variance with the FDA, reasoning that people who visited state-inspected, state-approved tattoo parlors should be at very low risk for blood-born diseases. The FDA listened and repealed the restriction, much as it did with regards to donors over the age of 66 and to people with unusually high red blood cell counts, both of whom were also prohibited from donating in the past. Unfortunately, Kathleen explained, these repeals took years of badgering and countless man-hours. Workers at RIBC seem wearied by the prospect of lobbying for a repeal on an issue as contentious as man-to-man sex, and thus unlikely ever to do so in the future.
<strong>Bureau-clots</strong>
Around the RIBC office, the prototypical FDA worker is envisioned as a bespectacled 90 year-old sifting drowsily through an endless pile of paperwork. The image is apt; both the myopia and the logistical morass speak volumes about the FDA's current approach to risk management. The FDA is a colossal bureaucracy, with a budget of over $2.4 billion and employing over 80,000 workers, which only slows the already glacial pace of change.
This backward-glancing, bureaucratic style of decision-making puts the FDA at a higher risk of being caught unawares by unforeseen pandemics. When the FDA first assumed the oversight of blood donation in the late 1970's, the earliest inspectors were ex-meat inspectors, many of whom admitted that they had never been trained for this task. Meat has blood in it, after all. It is thus unsurprising that the FDA was unprepared for the AIDS crisis that began in 1981, when an uncounted number of people received transfusions of contaminated blood. Among these victims were high numbers of hemophiliacs, who, in a poignant twist, are now banned from giving blood by the donor eligibility survey, precisely for their higher rate of (transfusion-contracted) HIV and AIDS.
<strong>Closing the window</strong>
Following the AIDS crisis, the FDA began implementing a number of preventative measures to cut down on the number of 'high-risk' individuals donating blood, specifically homosexuals, intravenous drug users and prostitutes. When the first HIV test was invented in 1985, the 'window period' (the time span between the contraction of the disease and its detection) was on average 22 days, and sometimes as many as six months. While the invention of the nucleic acid-based test has cut the window period down to between 4-12 days, Jeanne Egan argues that it is still enough time for HIV-infected blood to "slip through the cracks." Given this legitimate concern, it seems unlikely to Jeanne and many others that the FDA will ever lift their ban on high-risk groups of donors until the window period comes down to zero.
In light of this crucial impediment, gay rights activists concerned with altering the donor eligibility survey should urge Congress to increase funding for research initiatives working to design zero-window HIV tests. By quickening the rate of HIV diagnosis, such a test would expedite the reform process.
<strong>Looks like somebody's in need of a paradigm shift</strong>
Apart from supporting research initiatives, activists need to address the FDA directly if they are ever going to change the screening policy. Attacking community blood centers and the Red Cross is futile since safety protocol decisions are ultimately out of their hands. Instigating a boycott of blood drives--which some activists have proposed--is worse than futile: it would cost lives.
Perhaps the most cogent solution has been proposed by Dr. Joel Ginsberg, director of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Foundation, who argues that the FDA needs to shift from a paradigm of demographic risk to one of behavioral risk.  He rightly points out that what puts people, regardless of their sexual orientation, at higher risk for contracting STDs are certain well-studied unsafe actions, many of which the donor eligibility survey already addresses. A behavioral model would also remedy the unreasonable 'permanent deferral' for West African immigrants who have repeatedly tested clean for blood-born pathogens. Updating the paradigm of risk management and setting up avenues for previously high risk donors who are verifiably disease-free to donate would be effective and deeply needed steps for the FDA to take.
In the past, activist groups have been offered to meet with the FDA in Washington, Kathleen Connolly says, and yet she recalls that "no one showed up."  If the screening criteria are ever going to be changed, concerned activists are going to have to show up. And when they do, they will need to lay out a case for why screening based on demographic risk is wrong not just for one particular group, but is wrong, both philosophically and practically, for every person involved in the business of giving and receiving blood.

		<title>BRIGHT WHITE LINES: COCAINE&#039;S CULTURAL POLITICS by Matt Sledge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The question of soul singer Amy Winehouse's life expectancy detains us. Her husband estimates "three months," but the videographic evidence suggests three minutes.

<!--more-->
British tabloid The Sun put the tape--the one where Amy goes on a drug binge--on its website. If she can be saved, as her father Mitch suggests, it will be because she says--along with 62 headlines on Google News--yes, yes, yes to rehab. The question of Amy Winehouse's reputation confounds us. She is a celebrity, and what the shocking tabloid revelations take away, the miracle curative powers of the rehabilitation clinic usually restore. But Amy didn't smoke just anything on the tape. She lit a crack pipe.
That's exactly why Barack Obama's admission that he once inhaled "a little blow" in his youth won't hurt his campaign, and that's why our current president's unadmitted cocaine use never hurt him, either. Winehouse forgot the inviolable precept of celebrity cocaine consumption: snort, don't smoke. As Whitney Houston put it during her infamous 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer, "Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack."
<strong>
Tupac's tired of being poor and even worse he's black</strong>
Houston's denial was motivated by the class and, more important, racial politics of cocaine use. To put it another way, crack is wack because it's (perceived to be) black. Crack is cocaine that's been cut down to an impure, smokable form. In the second half of the 1980s, American cities were hit by a so-called epidemic of crack use. Because of its cheapness and widespread availability, it was the new drug of choice for the urban underclass. News accounts portrayed it as an almost exclusively black drug, as opposed to its upscale chemical cousin, snortable cocaine. Crack was supposedly spreading from the ghetto to threaten suburban enclaves. In the wave of hysteria after University of Maryland basketball star prospect Len Bias's crack-related death in 1986, Congress dramatically increased penalties for crack possession. Five grams were enough to get somebody a mandatory five years in prison--as opposed to the requisite 500 grams of cocaine.
The racist and classist perceptions of crack have never really left the popular imagination, and in certain circles cocaine still makes a fashion statement. Witness two relatively recent exercises in 1980s nostalgia: high rollers and Wall Street moneymakers snort coke in American Psycho, and it's the poor blacks a hundred blocks up in Harlem who smoke rocks in Paid in Full. At Brown, it's wannabe decadents who do cocaine--nobody smokes crack.
Consider the strange career of the crack joke during the 1990s. In middle school cafeterias, in otherwise sensitive houses, in well-appointed boardrooms, it was hard to go more than a few days without hearing this line tossed off carelessly and lightheartedly in response to a particularly embarrassing flub: "have you been smoking crack?" The crackhead was the ultimate criminal boogeyman, at once both haplessly and horrifyingly desperate. By the 2000s, the memory of the crack epidemic had waned a bit and Dave Chappelle could play Tyrone the crackhead for laughs. Tyrone's motto: "I smoke rocks!"
<strong>
The penitentiary's packed</strong>
As Winehouse's on-screen bender vividly demonstrated, there is nothing inherently black about crack. There is nothing pharmacologically distinctive about it, either--it just delivers cocaine's high faster. According to a 1986 study, three of four people who tried crack never tried it again. Most of the purported 'crack babies' never existed; they were products of the same imagination that gave us the phantasmal 'welfare queens.' Mothers endanger their fetuses far more by drinking alcohol than by smoking crack, though neither is wise. But the cruel racial politics and the undeniable urban decline during the Reagan years made the drug an easy demon for rabble-rousing politicians and frenzy-fanning journalists alike. Sociologist Craig Reinarman pointed out in an October Washington Post editorial that "[p]erversely, small-time sellers serve up to five times longer in prison than the cocaine-powder dealers caught with the same weight, who may well have supplied them." Stiff penalties for cocaine possession were introduced at the same time that funding for drug diversion and rehabilitation clinics was drastically cut.
Chappelle quit his show over guilt about characters like Tyrone, whose comic effect emanated from the contrast between his black skin and his lips chapped white with crack. The injustice of his mostly white fans impersonating Tyrone Biggums (catchphrase: SHAZZAM!) finally got to Chappelle, who later told Oprah Winfrey that he thought some of his sketches were "socially irresponsible."
In 1995, Congress rejected the United States Sentencing Commission's recommendation to eliminate the disparity between crack and powdered cocaine. By 2006, 20 years had passed since the passage of the original law. In December 2007, the Sentencing Commission used its power to set sentencing guidelines to retroactively lessen penalties for nearly 23,000 prisoners convicted of crack-related crimes, many of whom will soon use the ruling to challenge their long incarcerations. Despite that change--made against the wishes of the Bush Justice Department--and a ruling by the Supreme Court that gives judges greater discretion to ignore the crack-powder disparity, penalties for crack are still much higher than for powdered cocaine. Only Congress could change the statutes that give the imbalance most of its bite, and only a radical reimagining of the drug war could change Congress's mind.
Many African-American politicians have made ameliorating the effects of the War on Drugs--which has more often been tantamount to a War on Blacks--a priority for years, as the consistent efforts to change the crack-powder inconsistency has shown. But their efforts have been stymied by indifferent or hostile presidents and a Senate whose electoral structure provides little incentive for its members to adequately represent African-Americans. As Tupac put it in "Changes," "both black and white are smoking crack tonight," but "we ain't ready to see a black president." Enter Barack Obama.
<strong>
Will some things ever change?</strong>
When Obama wrote his memoir Dreams from My Father in 1995, he was far from the national political scene--a decade away from even a spot in the Illinois State Senate. He could afford to be remarkably candid about his past drug use, writing that in the dissolute days of his Hawaiian youth in the late 1970s, "[p]ot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it." The key word is "blow," which seems to mean that he only snorted cocaine (and, the same sentence implies, maybe only when he got his allowance). Obama escapes crack's racial stigma; he becomes a youthful experimenter safely familiar to white America. What's more, Obama's book is literally a redemption tale: he escapes the perils of drug abuse and becomes a faithful Christian.
These days Obama can even afford to joke--at the Clinton family's expense--about his past pot use. He told a group of magazine editors, "When I was a kid, I inhaled, frequently. That was the point."
Obama's candor about his youthful drug use is matched by his readiness to end the aggressive tactics of the drug war. His memoir may put him on the same side of the great crack-powder cultural divide as the suburban Wisconsinites from That 70's Show, but he has told reporters that his favorite series is The Wire. On that show's third season, a police major turned the Western District of Baltimore into an American Amsterdam. Obama hasn't gone quite so far, but his website does state, under the heading "Civil Rights," his belief that the crack-powder disparity is "wrong and should be completely eliminated." Equalizing the sentences for crack and powder cocaine would go one step further than the Sentencing Commission, which has only lessened the distance between the two.
Obama and Hillary Clinton both support greater use of drug diversion programs, which would send more addicts to rehabilitation instead of prison--an option that has been the province of the wealthy and white, like Winehouse. John McCain, whose wife entered rehab after stealing prescription painkillers from a medical charity in the 1990s, has been silent on diversion but has called for increased penalties for dealers and tighter restrictions on methadone clinics.
Far from American shores--denied a visa by our embassy, in fact--Amy Winehouse probably won't walk up the aisle to find God with Senator Obama any time soon. Her performance via satellite at Sunday's Grammy Awards, however, may have changed a few minds about addiction. Soulful, defiant, self-effacing, she sang "You Know I'm No Good" and then "Rehab" with equal parts vulnerability and wit, looking nothing like the inhuman 'crackheads' we've been taught to fear. Then she accepted her award for the record of the year, hugged her mom and thanked the people of London. Her continued sobriety is a thin reed on which to hang any sort of hope for the future, but for one night, at least, the rehab was working.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[January 3, 2008 ushered in the beginning of the lengthiest primary season in US history with the Iowa caucuses and more than historic headlines. In an episode widely covered by the media, Barack Obama became the first black candidate to win the first political contest in an election season and to exhibit widespread support early on.

<!--more-->
The same night, the media also reported the win of the Republican caucus by one Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas and a Southern Baptist seminarian. Although equally surprising, the Governor's win provoked fewer sweeping historic comparisons, and more responses along the lines of "Just who is this Huckabee person, and how did he win the election without us knowing who he is?"
The media has seemed surprised by Huckabee's victories, but has nonetheless devoted little time to the phenomenon of his success. Never mind that Huckabee's fourth-quarter receipts nearly matched McCain's ($6.6 million to McCain's $6.8 million) and that Huckabee carried three delegate-heavy states other than his home state of Arkansas in the Super Tuesday primaries; the fact that Huckabee has only 217 delegates--fewer than Mitt Romney, who has already dropped out of the race--would appear to negate those wins. The New York Times noted that McCain "all but captured the nomination" with his wins on February 5, and CNN.com featured the headline "McCain Claims Front-runner Status."
Yet Huckabee remains seemingly untouched by the naysayers; if anything, he seems more determined to win than ever before. "The one way you can't win a race is to quit it, and until somebody beats me, I'm going to answer the bell for every round of this fight," he stated as he addressed reporters on February 6. In a long shot race, Huckabee is still the dark horse, albeit one with heart.
It is uncertain, however, just where Huckabee's heart and determination comes from. It is unlikely that Huckabee imagined the strong support of his conservative Christian base, but even the wealthiest of political candidates who find themselves in third place for the delegate count would rather preserve their funds than try for a long shot. There is something that makes Huckabee both appealing to his supporters and horrifying to his detractors, though that something seems to transcend the conventional.
<strong>And how do you spell that? </strong>
Does a name like "Mike Huckabee" make a candidate unelectable? As conservative pundit Dennis Miller said, "We've never had a president with a last name like 'Huckabee'... it's like having a President with the name QuickDraw McGraw." Similarly, a variety of "Hickabee" jokes have peppered the scene. Indeed, it's hard to imagine President Michael Dale Huckabee being introduced to the United Nations as "Hail to the Chief" plays.
The name "Huckabee" is most likely a variant of  "Huccaby," a small village in Devon, England. With the more traditional English spelling, it appears slightly more refined, but nonetheless an oddity. The US Census estimates the number of citizens with the surname "Huckabee" to be near 2,500.
Yet an obscure British surname--even in a bastardized form--would seem unlikely to destroy a bid for the presidency. Names in general seem to have little effect on a candidacy, unless they are unpronounceable or appear to link the owner to a terrorist organization. (In early 2007, Democratic candidate Barack Hussein Obama briefly underwent scrutiny for his middle name, but disapproval quickly faded.) The simultaneous animosity and overwhelming support for Mike Huckabee appears to come from another source.
<strong>...and then God said, "let there be a candidate"</strong>
The quality that most sets Huckabee apart from the other presidential candidates and that wins him many of his supporters is also that which most disturbs his detractors: his religious beliefs. It is not difficult to find out exactly what he believes--a few internet searches reveal all one could ever want to know about his convictions. Huckabee believes in creationism, and while he has stopped short of specifically delineating this particular issue in the debates, he has frequently voiced his opinion that this theory--not just intelligent design, mind you, but creationism-- be taught alongside evolution.
Throughout the campaign, Huckabee exhibited a willingness to publicly display his faith, even when there was uncertainty as to whether it would help him connect with his audience. On February 5, after his resounding victories in several Super Tuesday states, Huckabee gave a speech consisting almost entirely of biblical references. NPR polled an assortment of listeners in the crowd, which revealed that few audience members, even those who claimed to be Christian, understood Huckabee's references to "the widows mite" and "the loaves and the fishes." Nonetheless, the Arkansas governor made no response to the report and has shown no sign of changing rhetoric.
Huckabee has hardly been apologetic in the debates about his unabashed endorsements of creationism and prayer in school. And why should he? They fit perfectly with his image and his platform. On his website, under the issue "Faith and Politics," Huckabee states, "My faith is my life--it defines me. I don't separate my faith from my personal and professional lives." James Robison, a televangelist and Huckabee's former employer, noted in an interview that "Huckabee's life has been shaped by moral absolutes." Christianity is at the heart of his life, on the campaign trail and off.
<strong>The author and role model</strong>
Huckabee has authored and co-authored nine books, more than any candidate remaining in the race. The book he is most renowned for is Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork, his 12-step program for weight loss based on his own experience dropping 110 pounds. Candidates' levels of fitness always make for a light side story; in 2004, USA Weekend ran a full color article featuring rather amusing pictures of Al Gore and George W. Bush in running shorts. Yet the press has remained strangely silent on the issue of fitness this year, and it's no surprise why. The book stands as a concrete example of its author's self-discipline and determination, outlined plainly for those who aspire to such lofty ideals and would care to follow him. How could anyone else compete?
Huckabee's other works exhibit similarly concrete examples of his ideals in action. Like most presidential candidates, there is the usual book--in this case From Hope to Higher Ground--detailing how his experiences have shaped his goals for the country. Yet even the title of this book seems to evoke an inspirational motto or how-to guide more than a ghost-written biography. Character Makes a Difference evokes similar ideals and features on its cover an affable Huckabee dressed in a button-down shirt and jeans lounging comfortably, legs crossed. Even the morbidly titled Kids Who Kill is inspired by Huckabee's own experiences in the wake of shootings in his home state during his one of his gubernatorial terms. Huckabee lacks a Senate record, a political science degree and military experience, but expressions of his values are no further away from the average constituent than the nearest Barnes and Noble. What better way to connect with the common people than through a compelling yarn, available for only $13.99? Huckabee's publishing record would seem to indicate that he has a story to tell, and an audience clamoring to pay to hear it.
<strong>Cynics and Supporters </strong>
With presidential candidates, there is usually little overlap in the dialogue between critics and supporters. Obama's proponents laud his fresh ideas while naysayers dismiss his lack of experience; McCain's supporters exalt his years of experience, while critics point to his age. With Huckabee, however, the line between negative and positive qualities is not so clearly drawn.
Looking for a reason to dislike Huckabee? "Ask the retarded Fort Smith teenager, raped by her stepfather, who sought Medicaid funding for an abortion as federal law required," writer Max Brantley noted dryly in a Salon.com column entitled "The Dark Side of Mike Huckabee." In an emotionally charged and highly publicized case, Governor Huckabee stepped in to prevent the Arkansas government from providing state funding. While Huckabee presents inflexibility horrifying to many, it's not hard to imagine the pro-life champions outside the Supreme Court being heartened by it, either. Where others see shades of gray, Huckabee and his supporters see black and white.
Huckabee has found support in the most surprising of places. Jonathan Alter of Newsweek endorsed him early on as "the GOP's best bet," while The New York Times ran an editorial asking "Who Doesn't Heart Huckabee?" Chuck Norris, perhaps Mike Huckabee's most well-known supporter, seemed to make note of the candidate's more intangible qualities in his official endorsement. After listing the most impressive qualities of the other Republican candidates, Norris expressed his belief that Huckabee is the only candidate "to have all of the qualities to lead America forward into the future."
While Huckabee's radical political views may make him much less than the ideal candidate, he is in many ways the ideal politician. For a straight-talking candidate, one need not look further than Mike Huckabee. There is no one else who does nothing to disguise the actions and beliefs that might make him unelectable; he speaks for himself, whether or not his audience will accept his message. After all, someone with such strong beliefs and moral fortitude need not fear criticism of his name or policies or seek approval; he knows he is right, despite whatever public opinion may be. There is no need for surprise when he wins an election--perhaps, he believes, everyone has finally realized he is right.

		<title>THE MAD RUSSIAN: IN PURSUIT OF A QUICK CIGARETTE FIX</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yefim Shubentsov has had an office at 1680A Beacon Street in Brookline, Massachusetts for 23 years. He has two secretaries, one young and one old, both Russian. Mr. Shubentsov claims to have been a member of the Russian Navy, a paratrooper, a teacher, a healer, an artist and an advisor to medical schools and hospitals both abroad and across the Charles at Harvard. He is not a doctor. He is not a hypnotist. He claims no direct link with God.

<!--more-->
"No connections," he says, pointing to the ceiling.
He takes pride in his physical appearance. He wears a black turtleneck, slacks and a sportcoat. He is balding neatly. He proves that he is "only muscle and bone" by instructing a female client to knock on his abdomen for the others to see. He does not eat between meals, nor does he advocate that his patients do: "Not even a carrot, because one, and you are big fat elephant."
He's been featured on 20/20, on Unsolved Mysteries and in USA Today. Amy Tan, Billy Joel, Courtney Cox, David Arquette and Drew Barrymore swear by him, or at least the magazines say they do. The inclusion of celebrities' names in his publicity materials combats the idea that he's a sham, a hoax, a quack. His name is hard to pronounce, so in the culture of quests for effortless self-help, he's known as the Mad Russian. His book, Cure Your Inner Craving, is a bestseller, and he is fully booked two months in advance.
I knew the date of my appointment for a while, which allowed me to smoke guilt free. "I'll take the buy-one-pack-get-one-free deal. I'm quitting cigarettes in thirteen days." I smoked my last one overlooking the skating rink at the Boston Commons on a cold Saturday morning.
<strong>All smoke-free on the Eastern Front</strong>
His waiting room occupied what had once been the sitting room of a Gilded Era family home. A dry fish tank filled with sand, plastic plants and toy dinosaurs separated two seating areas. Oriental rugs and plush velvet sofas bordered the room. Ornate gold framed oil paintings, each dated and signed "Yefim Shubentsov," lined the wooden walls, depicting stormy seas and hillsides attacked by fantastically tacky neon sunsets.
A collection of guilty people, gaunt and grey and smelling of smoke, sat around us, turning off cell phones. We were as silent as cats at the vet.
The older secretary gave me a form and read the different categories of things that could be cured. She spoke as one would speak to children or morons, probably accustomed to people asking her to repeat things. "You have here, cigarette. Here, drugs. Maybe co-ca-ine, mar-i-juana, pain-killer, alc-ohol. Phobia, like airplane phobia, snake phobia. Other habits. This like bite nails. Weight loss." She pointed at the words "weight loss."
"Weight loss not today. Different session. You can cure as many problem as you want. Same price. Okay $65." I handed her three twenties and a five and told myself it was money well spent. If it did work, it was a pretty good deal (Americans spend billions on cigarettes, not to mention quit-smoking gum, patches, seminars, homeopathies, books, tapes, therapists). If it didn't work, I could probably make my money back with the reward Unsolved Mysteries would pay me for solving this one.
The session began with a ceremonial dropping of smokes and lighters into a brass rubbish bin. I didn't have any with me to throw away and felt that I should have brought some. For a moment, I fantasized about some psychotic un-cured smoker grabbing the whole trashcan and running out of the place, saving himself a lot of money.
The Mad Russian spoke English so quickly and poorly that he was basically incomprehensible. As he began, the group of smokers seated around his office leaned forward, realizing that they were going to need to work very hard to get their money's worth. Surprisingly, his discussion rarely focused on cigarettes specifically. He touched the subject only once, saying: "I don't need to tell you smoking is bad. You know this already, this why you come here. Cigarettes not part of your life anymore."
He believes that in order to cure addiction, one shouldn't replace the addiction with another thing. "Not even carrots," he affirmed again. He also voiced many opinions that seemed entirely irrelevant, like that he is against giving children prescriptions for ADD. He told a story about parachuting. He strongly recommended that we all move to Arizona, California or New Mexico to improve our circulation.
<strong>I smoke, therefore I suck </strong>
I admittedly hadn't come into this with a good attitude. Not necessarily pessimistic, but not at all resolved that I actually wanted to quit, I had barely admitted that I had a problem serious enough to call for 'quitting.' What had driven me to the office of the Mad Russian was guilt. Smokers get no love from society. Save for a few tobacco conglomerates with lobbyists and pro-smoking nut-jobs with websites, it seems every race, creed, religion and party unite in anti-tobacco fervor in this country. But anti-tobacco really means anti-smoker. This free-flowing shame causes most smokers to hide the habit, become defensive or seek the exclusive companionship of other smokers.
At this rate it seems like smoker's guilt will kill me before heart disease, emphysema, bronchitis, or cancer even have a chance.
Smoking in the last half-century has become one of the only things that it's PC to hate people for. It's not culturally acceptable to walk up to a fat person and tell them to stop eating so much. Even alcoholism is treated with delicacy. Ask any smoker how many times they've had perfect strangers lecture them about how they should lead their lives. Ask them whether or not they've pointed out to that stranger that they should change things about their life as well, like not yelling at strangers.
A friend of mine, who never smoked, interned for Truth, the anti-tobacco lobby, one summer. After several months of sitting in a cubicle from nine to five, thinking only about smoking, he began taking cigarette breaks. It seems ironic that people who are well-educated and intelligent take up smoking anyway. Another friend, who took up smoking in the months following his father's sudden death, remarked upon this phenomenon. He said he thinks most people like us smoke because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy: I have a sucky life, so I smoke; I smoke, therefore my life sucks.
The People v. Parliament Lights (a trial conducted in my mind, in its fifth year).
For the plaintiff: the Surgeon General, general social compliance, self-hatred, my friends who don't smoke. For the defense: my friends who smoke, Joni Mitchell, Betty Draper, Gatsby, Franny and Zooey, youth, the fact that I don't do lots of other bad things that plenty of people do, fatalism. Quit smoking and you could still get hit by a bus. Smoke, because you might still live to 90.
Of course, all this debate could simply be my addicted mind throwing sand in my own eyes. Addicts are terribly good at arguing.
<strong>Alone with the Mad Russian</strong>
It was a two-hour act he had performed thousands of times before. As the Mad Russian spoke, his hands rhythmically moved through the air. He claims to have the power to manipulate the life-energies that surround us, a power that not even science can explain. Apparently he tricks these energies into forgetting that they ever wanted cigarettes--a pre-smoking rebirth. With the incomprehensible monotony of his voice and the waving hands, I suspected he was trying to hypnotize his crowd.
Suddenly he raised his voice and pointed at a woman in the room, startling her. "Do you have pain?" he asked. He had to repeat himself several times as she tried to untangle what he had asked her. When he repeated himself, he did so as though her inability to understand him was something she needed to get over. "Yes, I have pain," she eventually replied. He asked where, and she said her joints. He waved his hands and asked if the pain had decreased, stayed the same or vanished entirely. She said it was better. I wondered whether anyone ever said it had gotten worse. He asked each of us these same questions, sometimes flipping his wrists or painting circles in the air with his thumbs, different motions for different pains. I said my back hurts sometimes and he asked me if my pain had decreased. I said yes, because I figured it would be awkward to say no.
The 20 of us had sat through two hours when he told us all to leave the room and then re-enter, one at a time. Suddenly we sprang back to reality, half-sedated, shuffling past one another, unsure whether we were yet cured. When I re-entered the room alone, I was a little afraid. He was smaller up close and told me to close my eyes. He told me to think in my head I am smoking, I am smoking, I am smoking. I heard the wisp of his breath; he said I could open my eyes and told me to leave. I thanked him.
The Mad Russian claims that his technique is effective for 98 percent of his clientele. He furthermore guarantees that if anyone wants to return to his office for subsequent sessions, they may for life, free of charge. He said that less than one percent of people return seeking free sessions; any more and his business would go under. Of course, this could be because all the people he hasn't cured know he isn't going to cure them the second time, either.
Conspiracy theories are exciting. Though I would have been astonished if the Mad Russian's unexplainable powers had magically cured me, I was not shocked that they didn't. Perhaps I'm too cynical, perhaps I'm not ready to quit. Most philosophy relating to addiction agrees: quitting can only begin when addicts themselves are ready to change. I cannot declare definitively whether this man from Moscow has some scientifically unexplainable power. It seems reasonable, though, that belief in his powers, in combination with a great desire to quit, could explain his apparently high success rate. Thus, the more people who don't disprove the methods of the Mad Russian, the greater possibility he may save some people's lives. In the meantime, I'm holding out for the invention of a cancerless cigarette.

		<title>ZOOROTICA: WATCHING ANIMALS SCREW AT THE ZOO by Chloe Malle</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Valentine's Day in the heart of New York's Central Park, "Jungle Love" ceases to be merely a mating call for Steve Miller buffoons; it's the name of the Central Park Zoo's annual adult entertainment show, headlined by a gang of horny baboons. On February 14, zoos across the country are tearing a page out of Larry Flynt's book and discovering that sex really does sell. Grabbing onto Hallmark's penguinic coattails, zoos will charge guests a prix fixe of up to $80 for an evening of bestial adult entertainment, food and drink included.

<!--more-->
Conceived 20 years ago at the San Francisco Zoo by former penguin keeper Jane Tollini, "Woo at the Zoo" has taken off like a squid in heat, inspiring a host of similar programs. The latest sightseeing trend, animal sex tourism, is built for two--not such a Lonely Planet anymore. And just as for conventional attractions, every city has its own branding. "Woo at the Zoo" is a three-hour adult-only guided tour replete with champagne and chocolate for the fair fee of $60. Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo begins its third annual "Wild at Heart" tour near the South American aviary and ends with a candlelit dinner. The Honolulu Zoo, which uses its "Love Gone Wild" Valentine's Day event as a fundraiser for conservation, pulls out all the stops, serenading guests not only with mating crickets but the Honolulu Jazz Quartet, a traditional Hawaiian dinner and not-so-traditional Hawaiian martini bar catered under the stars.
The brilliant combination of champagne and candlelight with hippos and their aphrodisiacal excretions was a cash cow waiting to happen. The idea was hatched one morning when Jane Tollini spied a penguin courtship ritual culminating in what she described to the San Jose Mercury News as "bowling pins making love." "The keepers get there early and we see things that other people don't see," Tollini explained to the Independent. So, she figured, why not allow other voyeurs the pleasure and set the ritual to Johnny Mathis tunes--the makeout soundtrack of her generation? Her bosses were turned on by the idea and a zoo tradition was born.
<strong>kama zootra</strong>
Despite the delightful variety of these animal sex tours from zoo to zoo, several characteristics remain constant. For instance, the adult-only label is taken seriously; guests must present a state driver's license or alternate form of identification to prove they are at least 21. Another unifying trait, perhaps shocking to us stale corner-bistro-on-Valentine's-day types, is that these events are always, without exception, sold out from advance reservation. "This is one of the most popular programs that the zoo has to offer, going into its 19th year," San Francisco Zoo spokesman Paul Garcia told the Independent.
Depending on the zoo and its specific residents, the tours will vary from place to place; however, most include an educational element to make the voyeuristic events' peeping Tom element a bit less, well, creepy. Tour guides, all holding degrees in either Biology or Zoology, will educate "Wild at Heart" guests with a 90-minute multimedia presentation offering a scientific look at animal reproductive practices, including courtship rituals and quirky procreation habits. Other presentations explain how species maintain their populations and how the zoos assist inmates in the reproductive process.
Such an event even exists in Providence's own Roger Williams Zoo. And, true to its namesake, the zoo spreads a message of tolerance, advertising its February 16 "Love is in the Air" event to couples and singles alike, unlike other zoos that host couples-only tours. For $30 per person or $55 per couple, "Love is in the Air" promises dinner, a strolling violinist and animal encounters. Festive attire is recommended.
<strong>tHEY wAITED ALL nIGHT BY YOUR DOOR </strong>
Sex tours inspired by this idea have become so successful that even aquariums are jumping on board. The New York Aquarium in Brooklyn launched its first annual "Sex in the Sea" Valentine's Day singles mixer in 2004, capitalizing literally on the plenty-more-fish-in-the-sea idiom. The aquarium invites singles to nosh on cheese and wine while learning about the asexual--yet sexy--reproductive methods of sea anemones.
Like all dangerous liaisons, wooing at the zoo has its detractors. At a Honolulu City Council meeting, animal rights advocate Cathy Goeggel called "Love Gone Wild" "swarmy" and expressed concern that it conflicted with the philosophical aims of the city's Zoological Society. The immense popularity of the event has effectively silenced Goeggel, but there is also the logistical problem of mating schedules. Most animals reserve their mating practices for the daytime hours, but to avoid conflicting with normal schedules, most zoos' Valentine's Day events must be slated for Valentine's Night. The shows must begin after dark; it's impossible to host an adults-only event during traditional zoo day hours when field trips are coming in and kindergartners are swarming, and besides, there is an increased romance factor in watching the explosion of liters--yes, liters--of elephant semen under the opal glow of moonlight.
Jane Tollini is adamant when clarifying that "Woo at the Zoo" and other tours like it are not a sex-on-stage show. "The first thing I say to people on the tour is, 'If you came to watch animals doing it, then you should get out of the truck and go home and do it yourself.'" She explains that since the inception of her "Sex Tours"--the name has since been changed to reflect the San Francisco Zoo's family values--she never advertised it as an animal sex show. "It's not like you can go and say, 'Up, Rhino, up.' Sometimes with smaller tours we bump into animals who are doing it, but it certainly isn't because of us. The thing is, if you explain to people in enough detail--how big, how much, how many, how long--with a little imagination, you got it."

It is an overcast Saturday. The streets are quiet, and the sky is heavy with the promise of snow. Peer through the glass windows of AS220: vague forms are visible milling about the performance space. Push inside the heavy door and the cacophony of smells, sights, sounds evokes memories of picking raspberries or tasting tomatoes on a long-ago summer day. This is where the Providence Farmers' Market takes shelter for the winter.
The bluegrass band starts up, twin banjos twanging in jangled harmony on top of the stomping beat set by an upright bass. A flannel-clad fiddler cries out hymnal lyrics over the reel. There are farm-fresh eggs, earthy potatoes and homemade cheeses. A taciturn man sells briny oysters by the dozen from an ice bucket the size of a bathtub. A girl sidesteps through the crowd, pressing cups of hot apple cider into the hands of those wandering in from the cold. Its spice infuses the air and the music with warmth and draws smiles from the chapped lips of city-worn customers.
Farm Fresh RI (FFRI) says that its farmers' markets "add a distinctly rural dimension to the urban landscape and reinforce the value of vibrant public spaces in our modern lives." At first glance, such sentiments seem to be at odds with the reality of downtown Providence, where much of the population counts itself among the urban poor. Generally, a person living on the wages from a part time job isn't seeking the experience of buying food directly from the farmer who grew it. Instead, they're trying to get the most food for their money. The typical patrons of farmers' markets have enough money in their food budget to support the extra costs of buying organic or locally grown foods. Noah Fulmer, executive director of FFRI, told the Independent that usually "farmer's markets are in neighborhoods with a wealthier clientele."
However, FFRI is taking steps to change the nature of its markets in order to make them more accessible to everyone. Under the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) benefits program, low-income mothers receive $15 per season to spend at farmers' markets. Rhode Island's food stamp benefits (EBT food stamps) are generally intended for use at supermarkets. During the summer season of 2007, FFRI paired up with Rhode Island's Department of Human Services to allow customers to pay for farmers' market purchases with EBT food stamps, making it possible for low-income families to purchase more organic, locally grown foods with the funds allocated them.
The idea was conceived following the release of the 2006 Rhode Island Community Food Bank Hunger Issues Report. The report found that Rhode Island ranked 49th out of 50 states in the growth of the use of its food stamps program--despite experiencing a 56 percent increase in hunger over the past six years. Every year, a smaller percentage of low-income familes partook in the food stamps program. FFRI interpreted the report as an opportunity to make farm-fresh food more widely available to anyone, regardless of economic status.
To participate in the program, a food stamps-eligible patron (generally, a family earning less than $1504 per month) swipes their card at a station and receives one-dollar tokens to spend. The tokens may be redeemed for any fresh food product in the market. At the end of the day, vendors receive a check for the amount of tokens they accumulate.
Since its inception, the market has taken in approximately $500 from food stamp users, according to Fulmer. Technical difficulties with FFRI's card swiping machine curtailed the food stamps program at first. Also, says Fulmer, "not many people know about [the program] yet." But he hopes that word will spread and the number of food stamps customers will increase during the summer season, when more markets open up around Providence.
There was a similar consensus among the vendors: not many customers have paid with food stamps yet. But, as one bespectacled farmer said, weighing a bag of apples, "They're always welcome."
The sight of customers reaching into wooden crates to examine potatoes or to knock hollowly on the sides of gourds is familiar to anyone who has ever stopped at a roadside stand, perhaps for sweet corn or for strawberries. Even in this dimly lit room, located on a city block, the simple purity of the farmer's market is evident. It is a quiet communion between fruit and nostril, between farmer and customer. And now, for many of Providence's low-income families, the taste of organic and locally grown fruits is not forbidden any longer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cut Folded Dyed & Glued, now showing at the Bell Gallery, is a show about material and process as literal as it is mystifying.

<!--more-->
Featuring the Korean-born artists Jae Ko and Imi Hwangbo, the exhibition displays sculptural works consisting of nothing more than mylar (Hwangbo's chosen medium; think space blankets and 'Get Well Soon' Balloons) or paper (Ko's), glue and ink. Having gone through the titular processes, these simple materials convene into complex works reflecting the negative space between material, process and product.
Like rolls of sample cloth or carpet swatches, Imi Hwangbo's pieces hint at large, patterned works cut down to a digestible size. Her candy-colored mylar sheets, cut and layered into reliefs, take cues from the natural world: Sylph appears to be a flattened bouquet of flowers, while Lepidoptera's pastel-blue clovers, framed by a lace of tessellated diamonds, would seem a colony of sea anemones. Reminiscent of an Ikea bedspread, the patterns and repetition belie the fact that each piece was painstakingly hand-cut and carefully layered. Hwangbo transforms mylar into something both intricate and skeletal, working the flimsy material with the precision of circuitry and stacking it like coral. Playfully uniting tedious process and imitative product, she highlights the distance between Nature (self-producing) and Art (self-flagellating).
Jae Ko's three works occupy the other half of the gallery, presenting an industrial-sized contrast. Untitled (JK 608), a set of ten boulder-sized folds of paper, lies scattered in a twisted heap on the gallery floor. The writhing, muscular forms suggest anything but paper and glue, rather ribbons of carmine taffy or boiling plastics, rapidly cooled. Untitled is flanked on either wall by two other Untitleds (JK327 and JK328), both series of jet-black rolls of paper rolled into thigh-thick slabs. The surfaces shimmer; at a short distance, the pieces look like charred wood or vulcanized rubber. Moving a few steps closer reveals a softer, velvety sheen.
While it's easy to get hung up on texture,  Ko's wry numeration complicates the stern beauty of the piece. As the show's title indicates, the interest lies not in the final, physical manifestation of artistic vision but in the miracle of process itself; brought to the fore are the hidden junctures that separate medium (paper, ink, glue), means (intricacy, precision and aggression) and ends (gorgeous, massively overworked gobs of texture). Ko and Hwangbo smirk at the inherent shortcomings of the traditional modes of piece, placard and pamphlet, revealing an object obscured by the hidden process of its creation. With the relative simplicity of a few handsome paper works, Cut Folded Dyed & Glued proves nothing could ever be as simple as the dry title suggests.
Cut, Pasted, Dyed and Glued will be on display at the Bell Gallery in List Art Center until March 5.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY</em>
Directed by Julian Schnabel
[Miramax Films/Pathe Distribution, 114 minutes]

<!--more-->
It's not so easy to make a good film out of senseless misfortune, tragedy of the violent, bodily sort--and it's probably even harder to make one about overcoming it. Julian Schnabel tries his hand at both challenges, with rather surprising success, in his The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. The film, in French with English subtitles, tells the story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, the former editor of Elle France who suffered a stroke at 43, leaving him with locked-in syndrome--he could see and hear but couldn't speak or move a muscle, with the exception of his left eyelid. Bauby learned to communicate by blinking; he even managed to dictate a bestselling memoir, whose title the film takes as its own.
Schnabel starts the movie on a brave foot; he seems determined to spare us none of Bauby's suffering. For the first few scenes, we see all the action from the invalid's point of view. The camerawork is sublimely confusing. When he blinks, the screen goes black; when he tears up, it gets blurry. Not too long into the film, a doctor sews his right eye shut to keep away infection. We see a needle piercing his eyelid, just as he would, and it unites us with him in a state of impotent horror and gut-wrenching disgust. When the camera moves to the third person, it comes as a biting revelation: his lower lip is slumped embarrassingly to the side, and he looks, in his words, as though he just "came out of a vat of formaldehyde."
After this marvelously fucked-up opening, the movie wavers between the brilliant and platitudinous. The darker scenes are consistently convincing, and Schnabel effectively weaves strange dreams and murky diving-bell imagery into the fabric of the film. He has a harder time with Bauby's victories over his condition--the matter of the butterfly. Here, his filmmaking falls back on clich√©. Bauby says at one point that two things are left to him, "l'imagination et la m√©moire." To illustrate this, Schnabel indulges in sweeping aerial shots of Caribbean beaches and a slideshow of childhood photos. To round out the butterfly metaphor, he throws in a couple closeups of insect life; although they're vaguely artsified and out of focus, they struggle not to look like something from National Geographic. From time to time, a bit of daytime drama-style piano dirge floats in, and in one flashback scene we even watch Bauby walk tragically right down the middle of an empty street in late-night Lourdes. The camera tracks him from, say, 20 feet above and 30 feet behind, trite and quite self-satisfied.
Luckily, these moments are few and fairly far between, and the acting is consistently exquisite. Mathieu Almaric, playing Bauby, manages to squeeze a sort of half-comedic charm out of paralysis. His stream-of-consciousness voiceovers show us what a real triumph might look like: no sweeping revelations, no theatrical leaps of faith, but beneath a cloak of gallows humor a begrudging charity. At one point, Bauby describes a play he wants to write about his struggle with paralysis. In the final scene, he says, the protagonist jumps up out of bed, suddenly cured. "Shit," says the character. "It was a dream."
Max von Sydow, who plays Bauby's father, lends the film two of its most touching moments--in the first, a tasteful flashback, the son shaves his aging father; in the second, Bauby senior sobs on speakerphone as the paralytic dictates his responses in eye-blinks. And the fairly endless cast of female characters share the spotlight well without appearing interchangeable.
The film ends on a high note, artistically speaking. In another flashback, Bauby drives out to his ex's country house to see his son, Th√©ophile. As he drives through Paris, the soundtrack to Truffaut's The 400 Blows comes on, and we get a sequence of nouvelle vague-like shots recalling that film's opening. He picks up Th√©ophile and starts driving again, this time down a little country road. He complains of the heat and declares that it's going to rain, before he speaks his last voiced words: "We could have." The camera jumps, and we watch from the distance as, in a lovely, touching echo of the end of Rififi, Bauby's small convertible ploughs into the side of the road. His son jumps out and sprints off toward the nearest house as the Charles Trenet classic "La Mer" comes on, quaint and reassuring, couched in vinyl crackling.
These subtle, contrapuntal touches prove that Schnabel's come into his talent and found a distinct style. Whatever you think of his paintings (I happen not to mind them too much), it's undeniable that he brings something wonderfully painterly to film.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[i work day and night in a tennis ball factory. i glue the fur onto the tennis balls. i stand in front of a table holding the glue. one man hands me the ball and another hands me the fur. on my best days when i work well i can glue one hundred tennis balls.

<!--more-->
one day a man in a suit walked into the factory. hey edgar he said.
i ignored him.
he said something i didn't hear because i had gone back to the tennis balls. there were people in front of and behind me who needed them. gluing the tennis balls took a long time. i didn't look at him. i can't remember what he said while i glued.
he pushed me. i'm talking to you he said.
you are.
my boss mr. jorgas came over to us. is there a problem? he said.
no mr. jorgas.
mr. jorgas touched the man on the arm. he said can we help you with anything sir?
the man looked at me. he walked out of the factory.
i went to work again. at eleven i had a cup of coffee in front of the table. at three i sat on a bench outside the factory and ate a cold roast beef sandwich with american and mayo.
that night after seven i punched in my time card. i was walking out from work. the man in the suit appeared in front of me. he was wearing a winter jacket. i've been trying to talk to you he said. it's important.
good i said. i kept walking.
do you have a minute?
i need to go home. i need to wake up early.
just a minute.
i need to go home. i need to wake up early.
there's a bar across the street i saw. we could
i need to go home. i need to wake up early.
come on let's just go.
i don't want to get drunk.
i won't get you drunk. he grabbed me by the shoulders. he smiled. he walked me across the street into the crackerjack daniel. the bartender michael used to work at the factory. we're friends. he gets me free drinks. i didn't say anything to the man in the suit.
the man in the suit said a ginger ale and gin and tonic please. michael asked for seven dollars. the man in the suit left a twenty-dollar bill on the counter. he picked up both of the drinks.
guess which one's yours he said.
i said nothing.
he handed me the gin and tonic. i let it drop to the floor. the gin spilled all over. it got on our shoes. the man stepped back and looked down. jesus christ he said what'd you do that for?
because i don't like you i said. because you put a drink in my hand when you know i don't drink. because you want to get me drunk even though i don't want to. get me a fucking ginger ale.
he held out his hand to me.
no i said get me a fucking coke.
he ordered a coke from the bar and another gin and tonic. michael asked for seven dollars. he put down fifteen. he stuffed the coke into my hand. he pointed to a table in the corner near a pinball machine. some men from the factory were gathered around it. i wanted to join them.
i won't sit down i said.
i didn't ask you to the man in the suit said. he sat down. the men played pinball more loudly. the machine laughed. i drank my drink.
you need to stop playing games he said. face things.
don't shit me.
i'm not shitting you. i don't know what that means.
fuck you i said and i left.
*
the next day i came to work wanting music. i asked mr. jorgas if he would be ok if i wore headphones. he said it was fine so long as i worked well. i borrowed headphones from a coworker who was new at the factory.
do you like the job? he asked.
yes i said. i do.
that's nice.
yes.
do you get lonesome gluing tennis balls?
that's a stupid question.
the man in the suit walked into the factory. i put down my tennis ball and walked away.
wait he yelled. he waved. you can't escape me. you know that you can't run forever.
mr. jorgas came out of the office. is there a problem here? he asked.
no mr. jorgas.
mr. jorgas said fine. he turned to the man in the suit. he said if you've got business could you settle it later? we're working.
*
we sat in the bar at the crackerjack daniel.
how's work? he asked.
fine.
do you like it?
sure.
you're not very talkative.
i didn't speak.
he was holding a drink that he spat into. he slammed the glass down onto the table. why do you hate me? he asked.
i don't.
then what do you think of me?
i don't.
michael walked over to us. the man in the suit said sorry. he asked for another drink. michael looked at me. i shrugged. michael shrugged too. he poured the man in the suit another drink.
it must have been hard for you when mom died he said.
i drank my coke.
i'm sorry i didn't make it for the funeral. how'd you deal?
i drank my coke.
well?
you deal. you do what you have to. you do it and then you go back to work. i know you were working.
i was.
i finished my coke and put the empty glass on the table. michael poured me a new one. the man in the suit pulled some money out of his pocket. i grabbed his wrist. i said i'll pay myself.
i was fired from my job.
i let go of him.
i made fun of my boss without meaning to. i called him fat. he fired me, but i didn't know where to go. i kept going back to work. it got to be too much for me. i need help.
i said nothing.
you won't understand. my wife sleeps all day.
i was quiet.
i couldn't tell her. it would break her. you understand what i mean?
i was quiet.
do you?
i got tight inside.
please answer me.
yes i said now get on with your story.
i got home after i'd been fired and told her work was fine. i went back the next day and hung around the office. you know. just in case. eventually they hired me as a janitor. i was good at it. i know how to whistle. it's nice to have something that you can slip into without people noticing you. then somebody did. an old friend at work who wasn't really a friend. he called my name saying hey edmund, nice costume. so i ran. back home. but my wife was asleep. you don't have anybody, do you? at home, i mean.
no.
why not? it's nice. you could get someone to make you peanut butter and butter sandwiches like mom used to make. you could get fat again.
don't talk about that.
i'm sorry. hey. i'm flying back to the city tomorrow. will you come home with me?
i said nothing.
it must seem random to you. i don't know who else to ask. i was a shit to you when we were kids. but hey. you're all i've got.
i can't i said. i have work tomorrow.
i asked about you at the factory. they say you haven't taken a sick day in four years. you've built up vacation time. say your brother's sick.
he smiled. he put his hand on my shoulder. please help me he said.
i can't i said. i have work tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1
I met her at the young girl's funeral. We were sitting in the tenth pew, I remember. Our island is a small one, and the church was built in just proportion. The tenth pew is the last one: for the sinners and the outcasts, the ashamed.

<!--more-->
The casket was wide open. There were a couple houseflies dancing up above it, and beyond that, lamplights swinging in the breeze. There was a ring of rusty iron, hung on chains stretched from the rafters, and it held a dozen burning lamps. We have no lightbulbs here, we burn whale oil like savages.
She turned to me and said, "I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, what if it falls into the coffin? What if she gets a ring of oil lamps rammed into her chest?"

2
I have a bad habit of snapshotting. And so I thought: here I am, out on the tenth pew, and before me is a young corpse; up above it dancing houseflies; and a rusty ring of lamplights above that. There you have it, that is everything.
What would it matter if the ring fell? Why are we cringing at the thought? Precisely for the comedy of it. There is something laughing in the iron that pins flesh to coffinwood. Something hides behind the altar and whispers, this is not a holy object. No. It's what it is: a corpse.

3
Everyone was sitting silently. She took my hand and led me to the front. I couldn't understand what she was doing; I was searching through the faces. I was waiting for some strong fisherman to stand and seize us, lead us to the tenth pew where we belonged. The secret fear of criminals is that no man will stand up and restore the just order of things.
I didn't understand what we were doing--but she touched my shoulder, and she flicked her index finger at the body in front of us. There was some sort of gentle carelessness inside that fingerflick: the gesture stuck in me, like a sand grain in the slow mouth of an oyster.

4
Interlude. In Rome there was a thing called homo sacer, sacred man. He was cast out of the city; you could hunt him like an animal. But he was sacred--that is, filthy. Unlike stags and horses, he could not be sacrificed.
One bishop said, without a city, you cannot be a man. You are either a god or an animal. Another said that exile turns us into both of them. A beastly god and godly animal. Homo sacer is not god and he is not an animal. But he is also not a man.
He is purely insignificant: the butt end of a fingerflick, the dying-place of laughs.
I dreamt that I was dead once. I was wandering around the island, and everything was just as it should be. The men down at the docks were taking sacks of fish upon their shoulders. I called to them; they couldn't hear me. I was dead.

5
By the time the service ended, it was dark.
The islanders walked out in slow procession. They walked barefoot over dunes and docks and old wood bridges. They pressed their soles into the soil and did not pray but walked with silent slow remembering.
We did not join in the procession. We walked across to where my house was, isolated, looking out across Burnt Cove.

6
Interlude, again. Some miles outside of Rome, a lake, a hidden temple. The priest sits, waiting to be killed. He doesn't sleep. He killed the priest who came before him for the honor of it; and now another one will come to do the same to him. That is the simple cruelty of things.
All that's left is one slow floating moment, one more senseless moment before dying. He's got one friend, of course; that is his death, which does not hide like most deaths but sits right there beside him, maybe smoking. And there is something fairly funny in that.

7
Why do islanders believe in immortality? They live in a catalogue of fixed smells and ennumerated images. Each soul is sunk into the surfaces of everything. There can be no forgetting.
The smell of cities is the thick smell of a million bodies burning. Bodies do not sink into the soil. They float out over the suburbs and off into the cold steppes of forgetting. I was living in the city when my older sister died--so I panicked through her archives for the ticket stubs and plastic souvenirs. I chased the vestiges of her through parking lots. Try to hold a bit of airborne dust: your hand fans it away. I tracked the scent of her through every street, until it led me to the harbor and its salty laughing lack of smell.

8
Of course, there is something in an islander that will kill without a thought of it. That is as senseless as pressing your soles into the soil; it is just as sensible and just as much without consequence. It is no different from taking fish-filled sacks upon your shoulders and no different from spitting a pearl into the sea. It will wash back up, with little consequence, as sand.
Can there be killing on an island? Can there? No, there can't. Of course there can't. There can't be much of anything at all.

And what are city people when you throw them on an island, what do they become? The kings of floating cities; that is all. Kings of the tenth pew, priests of the trashheaps of remembering. Load them full up with remembering and give them nowhere to forget.
Then you'll see a rusty ring of lamplights pin a corpse to coffinwood. You'll watch a floating city sink and disappear into the sea.

I came back, inevitably. I came back on the mailboat, and no one really minded my departure. It was raining and the boat ploughed on through it. There was nothing but rain; sheets and sheets of it; silver and then grey and once more silver and then grey: like that to the limit of my vision.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE: BOBBY KNIGHT&#039;S LEGACY by Dave Hanyok</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After almost 42 years of coaching college basketball, Bobby Knight retired early last week from his position as the head coach of the Texas Tech team.

<!--more-->
Aside from his time at Texas Tech, he had a long, successful career coaching teams at Army and Indiana. He has more career wins than any college basketball coach, past or present. He has led three teams to NCAA championships, in 1976, 1981 and 1985; coached an Olympic basketball team; and received a number of awards and honors, including a place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Despite his many impressive achievements, he will always be defined by his explosive personality.
Coaching seems to attract people with anger issues, but Knight manages to stand out as remarkable, unmatched in the force of his fury. Leading his Indiana Hoosiers in a game against Purdue in 1985, Knight unleashed his legendary rage in what is still one of his most notorious tantrums. After three fouls had been called on his team within one minute of play, Knight was furious, shrieking obscenities at the referees who responded by calling a technical foul. Knight seethed as he paced the edge of the court, then reached for an empty chair. He threw it hard across the court, seemingly aiming for the referees. It looked like he fully intended to hurt them. He missed, the chair instead spinning into a crowd of photographers.
<strong>A public relations Knightmare </strong>
Given his relationship with the media, it's unlikely Knight felt bad for his accidental victims. Knight sees sports writing--and, by association, the rest of the media--as inane and bloated, full of hot air. To Knight it is a "profession... that's one or two steps above prostitution." He tolerates only the most straightforward analysis. When a reporter asked whether a win would improve his team's "momentum," Knight accused him of reading "fairy tales on all that bullshit." The statement marked a moment of restraint for Knight, who at that particular press conference was holding his grandson on his lap.
When there are no toddlers present, Knight's antipathy toward the press is often expressed far more explicitly. Even early in his career, he was notorious for his R-rated language, prompting one interviewer to ask him, "Coach, uh, why do you say 'fuck' so much?" In his response, Knight praised the word as "the most expressive... our language has" and gave examples of its many uses. His press conferences are sprinkled liberally with the word, especially when a reporter says something that he decides reflects a lack of basketball knowledge. And if a reporter is prying into any drama peripheral to the game, that sprinkling is likely to become a downpour.
Asking Knight about himself, his life or his personal relationships is invariably met with vehement contempt. Asked about his once-troubled relationship with University of New Mexico Coach Steve Alford, a former star player on Knight's Hoosiers, Knight called the question "an absolute crock of bullshit" and passionately denounced the tendency of the "fucking people in the news media" to "dwell on some negative piece of bullshit like that."
Knight's crusade against "fairy tales" and "bullshit" in the media has ultimately been undermined by his own antics. When he chews out a reporter for focusing on anything other than the game, he is developing for that reporter a story completely unrelated to basketball--and he's putting himself at the center of it. Ostensibly in protest of reporters' lack of knowledge about or interest in basketball, Knight has on occasion turned his post-game press conferences into a joke. He once came out with a whip and proceeded to catalog its virtues as a motivational device in order to avoid answering questions. When he brought his grandson with him in order to "get along with the media," Knight spent most of the conference talking to the little boy instead of the reporters. At the end, he told the uncommunicative toddler, "You did really good. You evaded every question they asked." Rather than insisting that reporters focus solely on the game, Knight seems to have accepted that they won't; he makes himself their story.
<strong>Surprise! Bob Knight gets angry and freaks out</strong>
My favorite Bobby Knight video footage is much less popular than the chair-throwing incident or the many clips of his press conference antics. It is perhaps the best existing document of his anger. Shot at close range, the video captures every gesture, every facial tic and every movement Knight makes. His emotions are never far from the surface, so the wave of rage that crashes over him is evident in every brutal detail.
Speaking with an off-camera reporter, Knight begins talking about the disappointment he's feeling from the defeat his Indiana team just endured. He's visibly upset, obviously let down by his players' performance. Still, he's speaking calmly and maintaining his composure. Then, mid-sentence, he abandons his train of thought. His frustration is palpable at this point, and something seems to have snapped. He begins shaking his head, saying, "I'm really disappointed in the, in the..." And then he erupts. His face adopts a menacing grimace, and he kicks the closest thing he can find. "...in the FUCKING progress we've made." For a moment it seems like the rage has passed. "God DAMN IT," he yells, lurching forward, his wide-open eyes looking at once furious and bewildered. "Fuck this show, take this fucking show and forget it," he spews, fumbling to remove his microphone. He throws down his mic and storms out, yelling somewhat incoherently: "Forget--fucking--fuck the basketball."
Knight's obscene behavior hasn't been without consequences. He's been ejected from countless games, fined $30,000 by the NCAA for an outburst directed at an official and fired after a legendary career at Indiana University due to accusations that he physically assaulted a student. Coaching the US team at the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, he even managed to get himself arrested: he punched a police officer in the face. Luckily for Knight, the then-governor of Indiana refused to cooperate with Puerto Rican officials in the extradition process, and despite a conviction, the charges were ultimately dropped.
</strong>Knight's legacy</strong>
While it's obvious that Knight's temper has gotten him into plenty of trouble, it's extremely doubtful that he could have attained his impressive record without it. Knight was joking when he told a room full of reporters that the whip he was brandishing was the best motivational tool he had encountered, but that's only because he has the ability to give a harsher lashing with his tongue. A sampling from a Bobby Knight halftime speech: "This is absolute fucking bullshit... I had to sit around for a fucking year with an 8-10 record in this fucking league. And I mean you will not put me in that position again. Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't fucking believe. Now you better get your head out of your ass."
Inspirational, no doubt. But a few times throughout his career, when his gift for verbal cruelty has failed to adequately express his fury, Knight has had to rely on physical abuse--choking one player in practice, slapping another and kicking his own son in the middle of a game.
Knight's anger is only a manifestation of what makes him a great coach: he has incredibly high standards and is merciless in enforcing them. Some of those standards--his Godfather-esque insistence on respect and his expectation that his players will behave with class and dignity, for example--are outright hypocritical, but many of them, such as his insistence on full effort at all times from his players, are admirable and even essential for a good coach. Of course, Knight goes too far in enforcing his standards, on and off the court. On the court, going too far means winning more games; off the court, it can be a problem.
Bobby Knight could never have avoided being a divisive figure; he has plenty of critics. One of those has been Murray Sperber, an Indiana professor who denounced Knight's treatment of students as inconsistent with the ideals of higher education. Knight also has some fiercely loyal fans. They sent death threats to Sperber, who eventually came to feel so unsafe on campus that he had to take a year-long leave of absence. When a student's accusation that Knight had physically assaulted him led to Knight's firing from Indiana, threats of violence and student rioting got so bad that Knight, now acting uncharacteristically as the voice of reason, had to urge restraint.
But how will the rest of the world remember him? When it comes down to it, there are two facts that stand out about Bobby Knight. First, he's a basketball genius and a brilliant coach. His record speaks for itself in that matter, and hopefully the world won't let it get completely buried under the second fact, which is this: the guy acts like a fucking jerk.

Wallace Lewton, Ph.D. '08 in Comparative Literature, preparing a dissertation entitled "Limitless Balls: Updike, M√°rquez, Gombrowicz and the Role of Sport in 20th-century Fiction," interviewed during office hours with freshmen talking outside:

<!--more-->
To the Spaniards it is basquetb√≥l or baloncesto. To the Poles, koszyk√≥wka. Basketball, as the Americans call it, is a literary sport. It's a question of hermeneutics. Consider each offensive sequence as a sentence; he or she who develops the strongest group of sentences forms the most successful game. The sentences are placed directly in competition with one another, like books on bookshelves. One might raise a complaint with this metaphor on the grounds that while the game is a team effort, writing seems individual. To this I would point to a counterexample: NBA All-Star Weekend, occurring over the course of the next several days.
The weekend's events, broadcast on Turner Network Television and commentated upon through the erudite annotations of Ernest Johnson, Jr., Kenneth Smith and Charles Barkley, consist of activities like the fledgling freshmen players in contest with their sophomore counterparts, established veterans playing two-on-two with guest lecturer-celebrities and a bout of glorious albeit self-indulgent maneuvers called 'slam dunks.' These are the perspectival bread-and-circuses endeavors that one might think of from Roman times, what Marx wrote about when he discussed proletariat labor exploited by the bourgeoisie. None, though, compare with the All-Star Game on Sunday night.
The Game is a two-and-a-half-hour (sometimes longer) narrative in which the Randian figures whom we judge 'the best of the best' square off, though disregarded non-selections like Ray Allen might disagree with my categorization. The starters are voted in by the fans and grant pleasure to the populace through isolated yet culturally resonant crossovers and jams. Little to no teamwork is present; the sequence most typical to an All-Star game is one player, often a small forward or a guard, charging like Diomedes against the other team's five so that he may thrust the titular ball through the net. Some thematically fecund moments in past All-Star Games are Tracy McGrady's passing to himself off of the backboard and Shaquille O'Neal's attempting a three. At game's end, a sterling player-author is selected as its MVP. For my money, this year it will be Kobe Bryant.

Diamond Jim Brennan, interviewed at a cryogenics center near his home in Dallas, Texas:
I'm a gunslinger--the best you've ever seen. I been one ever since I was little, when my ma use'ta feed me bullets full o' milk. My partners all died at Little Big Horn. When I heard there were other gunslingers, I grew mighty confused.
Turns out this new crop o' gunslingers don't use bullets, just basketballs. 'Stead o' firin' into a man's heart in the dead o' night 'n watchin' his wife 'n babes cry for mercy, this new pack o' varmints stands outside the three-point line, not even man enough to drive to the rim. While you got your Eastern Conference gunslingers like Paul Pierce 'n Rip Hamilton, most o' the rascals are in my place, the Wild West. Thirty games left this season, 'n the conference's so packed that the 10th-best team ain't lost much more than the leader. The All-Star game's Sunday, 'n there'll be Western ball-packin' killers like Kobe Bryant 'n Allen Iverson playin'. You ain't seen this much shootin' since the Alamo.
The game'll be in New Orleans, a fine home for it considerin' the disasters that those folks've been through. It's also appropriate 'cause o' the New Orleans Hornets, holdin' one o' the West's best records at 36-15. They were poorer'n a church on Saturday last year, but when you're young 'n able-bodied you can turn things around. They got that old Europee'in varmint Peja Stojakovic, but they also got a great big forward in David West 'n a beaut of a point guard in Chris Paul. This'll be the first All-Star Game for the both of 'em, though West robbed Baron Davis 'n took his spot. Paul's averagin' 20-plus points 'n 10-plus assists. The scorin' point guard is the best kind o' gunslinger: he can fire at will 'n still have bullets to go 'round. Folks're fawnin' 'n cooin' over the surprisin' young Portland Trail Blazers, but they've been shot in the heart lately. The Hornets're for real. They've got their division lead over my hometown team, the Mavericks, who've proved 'emselves soft cowards in the playoffs the past couple o' years 'n so I don't trust 'em for nothin', not even fetchin' my spurs.
'N speakin' o' spurs, San Antonio has once again got themselves one o' the best records around. They're the defendin' champs, remember. They're the oldest team in the league but they're crafty, 'n they just got older 'n craftier by signin' ol' backup point guard Damon Stoudamire. There're a great many teams out there tryin' to get better than them fellas by makin' crafty trades. One o' the biggest uns, both literal 'n more poetry-like, came when the Los Angeles Lakers got theirselves Pau Gasol for a couple o' draft picks 'n a plaster bust o' Kwame Brown. Gasol's a seven-foot Spaniard who can't guard nobody but can getcha a 20 'n 10 in points 'n rebounds. The Utah Jazz stole sharpshootin' three-point man Kyle Korver from his home in Philadelphia, 'n the fast-runnin', fun-lovin' Golden State Warriors got a little older 'n slower by addin' washed-up Chris Webber.
The gordito burrito of 'em all's been them Phoenix Suns landin' Shaquille O'Neal, that 360-pound bag o' quicklime, from the Miami Heat for defendin', scorin', reboundin', runnin', discombobulatin' forward Shawn Marion. Phoenix, averagin' 110 points a game to lead the league, is the fastest team there is, but they're slowin' down with the hurtin' 36-years-old center. They think he'll make 'em tougher 'n help their chemistry. He may get 'em a few big, loud dunks to send coyote howls through the desert, but he can't defend for beans. Or jump for nachos. Or hit free throws for chocolate. Fact is, he's less like a man now 'n more like a 'tater. The Suns beat teams by forcin' 'em to play at their pace, 'n since Shaq's too big 'n slow to run they'll be playin' four-on-five on defense every night. T'ain't natural.
You'll have to excuse me. It's my turn in the freezer.

<!--more-->
The roof is just that. It is a roof. The surface of it is only made to prevent rain from going through, it is not meant to hold people, or have them walk on it.  It will get holes and dents and begin to leak through. If not sturdy enough it might fall with someone on it.
That is not the least of it.  It is slanted. Someone could fall off.
There is no banister - obviously -
On all roves that are made to be used, there is a banister.
Lastly if anything seriously happens to you I'm libel -------that is a long
discussion. In the lease it says that I, the landlord, and owner of the house, not the
mother, can promulgate rules from time to time which I deem appropriate.
I have told you not to sit on that roof. There was a sign up in front of the window telling people not to sit on the roof. The screen in front of it was fixed, and is now broken.
What else am I to do?
I can call "your mother."
I can call the university and complain.
I can take you to court.
I prefer to trust that you will behave like adults.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mitt Romney Flip-Flops, Talk Radio Flips Out</strong>
"Unless America changes course, we could become the France of the 21st century," Mitt Romney told supporters last Thursday.

<!--more-->
The Republican presidential candidate with decent CEO grooming and great personal grooming uttered those words with baguette crumbs flying as he suspended his campaign. He had appeared in front of supporters the prior Tuesday wearing a red beret and a mustache and declared that "we" were going to win. John McCain had earned 714 delegate votes once the results had been tallied, while Romney had earned only 288. Three of the states that he had won, Utah, Michigan and Massachusetts, were states he had lived in. Romney vowed next time to buy homes in California, Florida and New York.
He claimed to be withdrawing for the good of the country, neglecting to mention that he'd been given a McCaining. America should stick to its values, he said, including reducing government spending and fighting in Iraq. He did not notice the contradiction. As he spoke of banning gay marriage and building incense-scented shrines to Reagan, the crowd chanted, "Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!" As always, Romney proved himself a master with audiences.
Conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, who introduced Romney, was in the audience; at one point Romney thanked her and "all the talk radio" for keeping conservatism alive. After the speech ended, Ingraham and fellow conservative radio and TV personalities Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, all anti-McCainaanites, met up to commiserate. They played canasta, drank beer and discussed immigration. "We need to line 'em up against the wall and shoot 'em," Coulter suggested, to which Ingraham said that derisive cackling would suffice. As the night turned to morning, Limbaugh brainstormed ways to turn his dittoheads into Clinton supporters. Ingraham said that Clinton might not win the Democratic nomination. Coulter called her a faggot. They all had a good laugh. At any rate, Ingraham continued, a McCain-Obama contest might make the Earth collapse from the weight of people crossing over. Limbaugh nodded sagely, then drunk-dialed Michael J. Fox.

<strong>HillSpawn</strong>
I love Hillary Clinton. I like freaking love her. She is so hot. But not, like, in a sexual way, because that would be demeaning to her strength as a woman. She isn't sexual at all. Well, no, I mean, not like she's an asexual robot or anything. If anything, she's like a hot robot, like that girl on Small Wonder. And while a lot of people have been saying that young people don't like her because she only got like 11 percent of the youth vote in Iowa or whatever, I still love her, every inch of her, from the top of her valiant head down to the bottoms of her powerful ankles, and I think that's proof enough that young people will come out and vote for her come whatever that day is.
To prove she cares about young voters, Hillary's done a ton of stuff. For instance, she wants to put all congressional hearings on a blog so young people who don't have access to C-Span or cspan.com but still totally care about congressional hearings can get access to them. And she started a group of young supporters called the HillBlazers. I mean, she's basically a rapper with the way she matches stuff with Hill (the Hillocopter, the HillStars, the HillRaisers), which is probably why 50 endorsed her.
Oh, and she released a new ad this week that targets the youth market. It features a bunch of really good looking young people, like 18-25 years old, I'd say, and they're all talking to the camera about how, one time, Hillary got up on stage at a concert and rocked out with their band, and how she totally "shredded," and how "it was all over the blogs." They use that last word a bunch for some reason. Unlike other stupid online videos that are user-generated and look like crap, this one looks really good because it was put together by professional media consultants and it stars really hot actors in really hot hoodies. What I particularly appreciated were the wacky camera angles and fast zoom-in-and-outs, which totally reminded me of when Bill Bellamy hosted MTV Spring Break. The format was a total spoof on VH1's Behind The Music, which I also love watching (on VHS). And then for the kicker at the end, these really fresh white letters on a bright blue background say, "Okay. Maybe Hillary doesn't shred. But she will: Make College Affordable. Fight Global Warming. End the War."
And that totally hit home because, like, those are literally the only issues that I as a young person care about.

<strong>Air Bud</strong>
A Tampa dog named Jet is only just now recovering from what is being called "the miracle landing" by local veterinarians, an incident with purportedly no evil intentions behind it whatsoever. According to his owners, Jet 'somehow' found 'some' kind of 'way' to 'get' himself a running start off of a multi-level 'parking' garage at the Tampa airport this past New Year's eve. After a free fall--now seen as harrowing and anecdotal--from six f[uck]ing stories up, Jet got up and walked away. Poor magnificent bastard.
Jet, the two-year-old, 65-pound black Labrador retriever, allegedly escaped from his owners' truck parked on the ninth floor, ran to his owner and was going too fast to keep from slamming into the four-foot retaining wall. So he leapt. Leapt like a circus clown into a big, fat, delicious, elephant-soiled vanilla pie. But there was no pie. Nope, just a third-floor roof made of concrete. After a thud and a whimper, a witness--who nearly became the heroic man who broke a dog's six-story fall--claimed that Jet got up and walked until his master told him to "stay," after which he waited for his owners to come down and drive him to the vet. Sounds like Jet's a well-trained dog. A little too well-trained.
Certainly something is amiss here. We're supposed to believe the couple named their dog Jet because of his shiny black fur? That the setting was coincidentally at the airport? That the 'witness' (or spectator?) was just on time to see the event happen? And that this incident just so happened to take place on the drunkest of all eves, New Year's? The convergences abound, overwhelming all reason. It sounds to me like these sickos had been training Jet to be a martyr for nomenclature. (One can only imagine the kind of perverted things they do to their friend "Pat." Lest we mention "Sadaam.") "Hey, dudes. Jet's got this sweet trick you have to... wait, honey, it's 11:59? Shoot, alright: five, four, three..." Some real Dick Clark, Times Square shit--you get the point.
Now that the big Jet trick's done, what's next for this humane society-abominating couple that treats its pets like so many looney tunes? Oh, oh, I got a great idea. How about they get some kind of desert-dwelling bird, restrict its ability for flight and call it "Roadrunner"--sure, that'd be a sweet bird--make him enemies with a coyote, "Wiley," strapped to a rocket for a Fourth of July spectacular. Then they and the press can laugh all the way to the bank. Jerks.

<strong>Head in a box</strong>
P<em>ersons of the dialogue:
SOCRATES, a corrupter of the youth
JASON MICHAEL FIFE, 34, of Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania
</em>
Socrates:  So, Jason, you mailed a cow's head to your wife's lover.
Jason: Indeed, Socrates.
Socrates: That's a pretty silly thing to do.
Jason: Quite so, Socrates.
Socrates: Looks like someone was overcome with senseless passion, am I right? You can't let yourself be consumed with emotion like that.
Jason: Yes. I am ashamed.
Socrates: I bet you got the idea from The Godfather. You know, that scene with the horse's head. Did you ever see those horse-head pillows? Those were sweet.
Jason: I agree.
Socrates: They were soft and fuzzy, but in the shape of a horse's head. Just the head. So when you put one on your bed it kind of looked like that scene in The Godfather where the guy wakes up in bed with a horse's head.
Jason: Jack Woltz was, I believe, the name of the character.
Socrates: Yeah. So this is exactly what I'm talking about with people getting silly ideas from movies.
Jason: I see that clearly now.
Socrates: Except you didn't even use a horse's head. What, you can get a cow's head but not a horse's? And what was the point, anyway? It's not as if this guy was really fond of this cow or anything. It's just sort of a mediocre version of something that's been done before.
Jason: Of course you are correct, Socrates. My foolish act was one four times removed from the real. A mere imitation of a scene from a film adapted from a novel inspired by real life, which, as we know, is itself a step down from the realm of ideas.
Socrates: I guess. That sounds more like Multiplicity--definitely Michael Keaton's best role ever, by the way. But it's mostly just weird. How did you even get the head?
Jason: I told a butcher that I desired the skull for decoration.
Socrates: Really? That's practically as weird as telling him you were going to put it in the mail. Frankly, I'm surprised it was that easy. But it sounds like you put a lot of thought into this.
Jason: I did, Socrates. I even froze it before posting it in order that blood might not seep through the box, alerting the authorities of its contents.
Socrates: That's pretty clever, though it probably would have been cleverer not to send it at all.
Jason: I know.
Socrates: What's also weird is that the guy you sent it to opened the box at all. I mean, it was just dripping blood all over his doorstep, right?. Also weird: the fact that this move convinced your wife to take you back.
Jason: Certainly. Quite right. Your wisdom astounds me, Socrates.
Socrates: Don't get smart with me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A yellow fist, outlined boldly in black, punches through the logo of the Providence Youth Student Movement (PrYSM).

The fist is a symbol of solidarity and struggle, appropriate to PrYSM's tenets of "love, family, ghetto-roots and movement." Movement toward a more just Rhode Island and a state government accountable to all its citizens were what PrYSM members Lucey Ok and Tam Nguyen demanded from Governor Donald Carcieri last December.

The two high schoolers criticized the layoffs of the only interpreters employed by the state Department of Human Services to work with the Cambodian, Laotian and Hmong communities as inappropriately targeting and undermining Southeast Asians in Providence. The layoffs came as part of the governor's attempt to trim the state's budget deficit. Ok and Nguyen argued the Governor cared more about balancing the budget than attending to the needs of its citizens. In response to the criticisms, Carcieri spokesman Jeff Neal commented, "It would be more helpful if they provided concrete suggestions about what other spending coud be cut instead."

A month later, on January 22, the governor's wife, Sue Carcieri, told Providence Journal columnist M. Charles Bakst that the two teens had unfairly attacked her husband by calling his actions racist. "First of all, I think they have mentors who are much older than them who are training them up. You know--how those terrorists have kids blow up, you know, Benazir Bhutto and so forth? You think the kids thought of it? I don't think so," she said. When the comments came to PrYSM's attention, the student group responded with outrage.

<strong>He said she said</strong>
Lucey Ok is a 15-year-old of Cambodian descent who participates in PrYSM. She attended a news conference held at the International Institute of Rhode Island on December 1 and spoke in protest of the layoff of the interpreters. The Journal quoted Ok as saying, "The governor is sending a clear message to my community that we are not valued or welcome. Well, this is my message: our community has been here for 30 years, and we are here to stay." 16-year old Tam Nguyen also spoke up, contrasting the state's fiscal needs with the economic interests of the Southeast Asian community: "Taking away interpreters from our community is not going to solve the state's financial crisis; it's going to create another financial crisis in my community, as elders lose their benefits and connections to state services."

According to official census figures from 2000, there are 11,600 Southeast Asians living in Providence, making up about six percent of Providence's total population. The unofficial data says the community numbers closer to 30,000. Ok and Nguyen spoke on behalf of themselves, PrYSM and the larger community. They did not expect to be targeted for speaking out, especially not by Rhode Island's first lady.

Mrs. Carcieri's comments have since come back to bite her. PrYSM has protested her remarks, holding a news conference last Wednesday, inviting the Carcieris to dialogue with Ok and Nguyen and demanding that the governor and his wife apologize. Mrs. Carcieri has refused to do so, and her spokespeople have claimed that her comments were not meant to compare the kids to terrorists.

<strong>What man behind the curtain?</strong>
Whether she meant to call them terrorists or not, Ok and Nguyen, as well as other youth involved with PrYSM, were insulted by the suggestion that they could not think and speak for themselves. At the February 6 press conference, Pirom Ting, a member of PrYSM, denied Mrs. Carcieri's accusation: "As youth, we are not brainwashed to speak up about the issues in our community. We are not mindless individuals and we can function without somebody telling us what to think." She defended Ok and Nguyen, saying, "My peers spoke in protest of the dropped interpreters, and what they said came from their own minds and their own hearts."

Marylin Soum, the 15-year-old daughter of one of the laid-off interpreters, also spoke at the conference. Addressing an absent Mrs. Carcieri, she said, "Yes, Sue, PrYSM has taught us to speak up, but they have not made us mindless puppets, unable to make our own decisions. If anything, they have taught us it is okay to think freely and that it is okay to help our community." She continued, "You have provoked us to use what we have learned to fight for, what we are entitled to, and what is our right as humans."

The speakers' commitment to their words is important for youth in a marginalized community. PrYSM, formed in 2001 as a grassroots response to gang violence and the threat of deportation in Providence's Southeast Asian community, aims to provide them with the confidence to become social activists. PrYSM runs three programs targeted at high school-aged kids: one for general leadership development and two specifically for women and queer youth. Members apply PrYSM training to advocating for themselves and their community. The four staff members are in their twenties.

One of them, Davide Gnoato, told the <em>Independent</em>, "It's all about civic engagement and training our youth to be strong leaders in the community." He said, "I learn a lot from the kids and the kids learn a lot from us--a mentorship between all of us. We mentor each other." He emphasized the youth-led nature of the organization as well as the social consciousness and activism coming from the kids themselves. He said the kids decide what happens; they are not told what to do. He agreed with their interpretation of Mrs. Carcieri's comments, saying she "insulted [Ok and Nguyen] by saying their speeches weren't even theirs."

<strong>Meet the press</strong>
Before Mrs. Carcieri's comments, Ok and Nguyen invited Governor Carcieri to revisit the layoff decision and to get more in touch with Rhode Island's Southeast Asian community. In his column, Baskt encouraged the governor to "reach out" to Ok and Nguyen. Mrs. Carcieri told Bakst that in doing so, the governor would be "rewarding bad behavior." She told him she didn't think it was appropriate for the teens to "say something really obnoxious and nasty [in order to] get somebody important" to listen to them. Despite these comments, the members of PrYSM again invited the governor and Sue Carcieri to meet with them to discuss issues affecting the Southeast Asian community. The Carcieris were also invited to the February 6 press conference.

Gnoato said he could not understand Mrs. Carcieri's position. "Calling kids who are actually doing things to change the community and do good in the community as participating in bad behavior makes no sense to me at all," he told the Independent. "I almost feel sorry for her 'cause she's just so out of touch with everything."

He noted that PrYSM genuinely hoped the Carcieris would come to the press conference: "We wanted an apology." But even better than an apology would be meeting on equal ground. "A way [for the Carcieris] to show [their remorse] would be to come to the facility and meet the kids," he said. "You're making decisions that affect these kids, why not come see what your decisions are doing, why not come see why these kids are outraged?"

The Carcieris declined PrYSM's invitation. Their absence at the conference gave more fodder to the kids who spoke. "It is unfortunate that we have leaders--both Donald Carcieri and his wife--who are not responsible for their words or actions," Soum said. Nguyen extended the invitation once again: "I have one and only one challenge to the Governor: will you meet with us?  Will you come down the hill and meet with the people whom you make decisions about?"

<strong>What is to be done</strong>
PrYSM and the Southeast Asian community have received the active backing of the Rhode Island American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU's Steven Baker, who attended Wednesday's conference, filed a suit against the State of Rhode Island for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids state agencies from discriminating against those who have a limited ability to speak English. According to a 1997 settlement of a suit brought against the RI Department of Human Services, this requires providing for translation and interpreters.

Gnoato noted that the ACLU's lawsuit ties in with PrYSM's Translation and Interpretation campaign, started last April. The campaign calls for greater access to these services in public schools. Gnoato said that PrYSM organizers believe the high dropout rate among Southeast Asian students is due in part to the inability of their parents to play a role in their education because of language barriers.

Soum also linked dropout rates to the interpretation work expected of teenagers by their families, especially in light of the state layoffs. "We are expected to be in places like doctor's offices, lawyer's offices, the DMV, school meetings and, don't forget, welfare offices. We are expected at all times of need whether it's before school, after school or even during school," she said.

Nguyen echoed his original statement from December, emphasizing the racist undertones of the layoffs: "The governor could have cut back many programs and reduced many salaries, but instead he is choosing to cut programs for low-income communities of color." He placed the plight of the Southeast Asian interpreters and the PrYSM youth in the larger context of issues plaguing immigrant and minority communities in Providence, stating unequivocally, "I stand in solidarity with my Black, Latino and Native American brothers and sisters; I stand in solidarity for all those who are struggling to make ends meet and I stand in solidarity with all immigrant families." Nguyen said he is no longer concerned with an apology from either of the Carcieris; he is more interested in advocating for change in Rhode Island.

		<title>MIXED MESSAGES: CONSIDERING BROWN UNIVERSITY AND UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["A Plan for Strengthening the College Experience at Brown." The subtitle of the report released this January by the Brown University Task Force on Undergraduate Education neatly captures the idealism of the students, faculty members and deans who convened last spring around questions of pedagogy, advising and general education at Brown. On the agenda were two divergent tasks: to critically reflect on Brown's mission for undergraduate education and to prepare for reaccredidation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

<!--more-->
This duality in the Task Force's mission reflects a much greater tension at the heart of any discussion of the University today. Former Brown President Henry Wriston argued in 1946 that Brown derived much of its singularity from the privileged position of its college within the larger institution. Yet the Task Force report comes at a time in which the priorities of undergraduate education--teaching and advising in particular--are increasingly surrendered to the demands of the research university. Discussions of the report have just begun to include the broader Brown community, and a paucity of student involvement suggests that few are aware of the urgency of the moment.
<strong>Piecemeal improvement</strong>
The report contains 25 recommendations aimed at improving the Brown undergraduate experience. Some reflect a serious desire to preserve the innovative curricular programs and dynamic student-faculty partnerships that enrich Brown undergraduate life. These include commendable suggestions to improve the quality of interdisciplinary programs, make advising more comprehensive, encourage pedagogical innovation and increase faculty involvement in Departmental Undergraduate Groups, capstone projects and Independent Study Projects.
Unfortunately, these recommendations are stymied by a national academic culture markedly less concerned with the undergraduate experience. Although many large universities emphasize the importance of teaching and advising to professors and prospective students alike, it is scholarship that makes or breaks an academic career. Professors in competition for tenure must publish prolifically and in the best journals. President Ruth Simmons has claimed that "Scholarship is the most important dimension of the tenure decision" and that "standards will always... be moving upwards." As they do, undergraduate education will be increasingly neglected by a university that cares more about research and self-promotion.
Brown's standards for tenure and its practice of luring celebrated faculty with reduced teaching loads more than undermine the Task Force's appeals for increased faculty involvement in undergraduate activities. Shaping faculty hiring and orientation around Brown's "distinctive student culture" seems quixotic given that new professors are often advised to be judicious with their service commitments until they have published enough to achieve tenure. Why should faculty teach more seminars, advise more GISPs and participate in other activities fundamental to an undergraduate experience if they are not rewarded by the University? Unless there is a reprioritization of undergraduate education, recommendations like these will remain well-meaning but ultimately empty gestures.
Recommendations designed to centralize information and coordinate services have a greater chance at being successfully implemented. However, as the report itself acknowledges, "A truly vibrant college experience... requires more than just resources." Centralizing advising information, creating a cohort of advising coordinators and identifying best practices in teaching will incrementally improve the undergraduate experience, but on their own they cannot do much in the absence of a systematic reinvestment in undergraduate education.
<strong>Sweetening the deal</strong>
When the question is one of reinvesting, money talks--and so does prestige. For example, the proposal to create a group of Faculty Advising Fellows who would facilitate more comprehensive academic advising is accompanied by a suggestion that these faculty receive either a research stipend or a salary supplement for their work. Similarly, a proposed funding pool sweetens the recommendation for cross-disciplinary team teaching. However, details concerning the implementation of these incentives have yet to be made explicit; more critically, they are too marginal to effect real change.
When Brown subordinates teaching and advising to research in its standards for tenure and promotion, it makes a statement about its priorities. And yet the Task Force report at no point challenges these standards, nor does the Dean of the College have the power to change them. The priorities set forth in the Task Force report must therefore be brought to the Provost, the Dean of the Faculty, the Tenure, Promotion and Appointments Committee (TPAC) and individual departments. If Brown is as serious about teaching and advising as the rhetoric of the report suggests, it is incumbent upon these bodies to make changes to hiring and tenure practices that will give prestige to undergraduate-focused work that is disregarded in the national academic environment.
<strong>Boldly Brown</strong>
It would be perilously utopian to deny the publication-oriented culture in which Brown is situated. Yet, precisely because it exists in this context of competition, Brown must seriously consider the question asked early on in the Task Force report: "What do we consider Brown's educational mission to be and what is required to ensure its continued success?" Although it may be in the belly of the beast, Brown can still demonstrate that its institutional culture is one that values innovation and investment in its undergraduate intellectual mission.
Because it cannot withdraw from its competitive peer environment, Brown must devise ways to leverage an alternative understanding of prestige within the institution in order to create prestige for it. In his essay, "Universities and Their Function," Alfred North Whitehead wrote: "Do you want your researchers to be imaginative? Then bring them into intellectual sympathy with the young at the most eager, imaginative period of life, when intellects are just entering upon their mature discipline." Brown must take seriously the generative potential of meaningful student-faculty relationships. The caliber of intellectual work that can emerge from these relationships cannot be underestimated, and it is by privileging such work that Brown can maintain the values of a university college while still asserting itself at the vanguard of intellectual innovation.
During the February 4 Community Forum on the Task Force report, Professor Sheila Blumstein of the Cognitive and Linguistics Sciences department explained how the recommendation to provide interdisciplinary concentrations with more faculty support could be reconciled with an increase in research-based hiring. Blumstein pointed out that institutional support to multidisciplinary programs could have positive implications not only for undergraduates, but for Brown's research profile as well. By forcing institutional structures to foster an environment that privileges innovative work between students and faculty, the University might enable its professors to push the boundaries of disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge in a way that peer institutions do not.
<strong>For the students, by the students</strong>
Revolutionizing hiring, tenure and promotion are ambitious aims that demand immediate consideration. In order for the Provost, Dean of the Faculty, departments and TPAC to entertain such possibilities, Brown students must take an active interest in Brown's future. The Task Force has held a few public forums whose spectacular under-attendance can be only partially attributed to poor publicity. Although a testament to their self-reliance, Brown students' remarkable ability to advocate for themselves individually--taking and adapting what works and leaving what doesn't--comes at the expense of community interests.
Brown students should join the conversations that the publication of this report has generated and should push them further, both within the Dean of the College Office and into bodies that exert greater influence over the future of the University. Dean Katherine Bergeron, who spearheaded the report, intends to reinstitute the College Advisory Board--a sort of council for the Dean of the College--as a means through which to carry on the work of the Task Force. Students must seize the opportunity to influence or even serve on this board, but they must also make their presence known outside of the Dean's office by pushing their way into corporation, faculty, department meetings and more. If Brown is to take seriously its responsibility to undergraduates, its students must take seriously their responsibility as undergraduates.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a world that increasingly resembles a Tokyo subway car, disparate cultures are bound to grate against one another. This friction can throw off the occasional sparks; most are fleeting and float off unnoticed, while others are incandescent enough to propel a bullet or catch an embassy ablaze.

<!--more-->
On February 13, two Danish newspapers ignited the Muslim world by republishing 12 depictions of the prophet Mohammed. Many had questioned whether the act was wise when the cartoons were first printed in 2005; few have asked that question this time around. When fresh, those now infamous images--the prophet wearing a bomb for a turban, or with a crescent moon forming a pair of devil horns behind his head--underscored the sense that this was not an act of satire so much as of provocation. The cartoons represented a brazen (and unsolicited) 'fuck you' to the Muslim world. Fuck you for trying to intimidate us out of drawing your prophet, fuck you for hampering our free speech and, some critics have convincingly argued, fuck you for invading our nice, white, provincial country. The act was arguably immature, certainly inelegant. However, upon their re-publishing, the cartoons have become abstracted and re-cast into iconic symbols of defiance in the face of strong-arm censorship.
Details regarding what happened following the original publication of the Mohammed cartoons but preceding the outbreak of rioting in the Middle East, Pakistan and Nigeria remain cloudy, though  one fact has emerged quite clearly: these were highly orchestrated acts of political manipulation. Realistically, the average man or woman in Tehran is not reading Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten with his or her morning coffee. He or she would never have even seen the cartoons unless a pair of Danish imams had not set out on a tour of the Middle East and widely distributed a dossier containing the offensive cartoons. The dossier even included three additional cartoons--one of the Prophet wearing a pig nose, another of a dog sodomizing a praying Muslim, and a third of a horned Mohammed grasping two young girls in his claws, with a caption reading "Den P√¶dophile Prophet Muhammed"--whose sheer artistic crudity (one is a photograph!) plainly indicates their falsehood.
The Danish imams' tour resulted in a host of riots and embassy-torchings that would claim the lives of 139 people. In February 2006, Pakistani cleric Mohammed Yousaf Qureshi issued a $1 million reward for the assassination of Kurt Westergaard, the man who drew the infamous bomb-in-the-turban cartoon. Two years later, the first attempt was made to collect that bounty. Three men--two Tunisians and a Danish national from Morocco--were arrested on February 12 for conspiracy to commit murder. In a wonderfully defiant knee-jerk response, the Jyllands-Posten and several other major Danish newspapers immediately reprinted the cartoons. The same results followed--riots, protests, expulsion of Danish consulates and the banning of Danish goods.
As with that other famous Pakistani-issued fatwa against a certain Satanic author, it remains important for free publications to vocally support efforts to resist religious intimidation and censorship despite the message that is under attack. For our own sake, we must champion free speech even when we do not agree with what is being said.
The Independent has said its share of disagreeable things over the past 27 years, and it has certainly handed out its fair share of 'fuck you's.' However, no one on our staff has ever had to write under the shadow of serious death threats or international upheaval. Jyllands-Posten deserves applause for their courage in republishing the Mohammed cartoons. We ardently hope that even in the face of intimidation we too would remain outspoken, rebellious and yes, independent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Sunday night was the Academy Awards, known by some as the Oscars and others as a pageant. It seems strange to get nostalgic over them, like loving the Pulitzers rather than books.

<!--more-->
The evening's vitality, its center of energy, lies not in the awards but in the nominated films. The point of Oscar Sunday, though, is to watch live attendees and briefly note the dead ones. The most beloved deceased are actors, which is why Heath Ledger ended the montage this year instead of Bergman or Antonioni. Next year Roy Scheider will be in it. The 77-year-old was at the end of his career; 28-year-old Ledger had barely begun his; but in a sense both their careers will continue forever. Ennis Del Mar will never grow older, nor will Chief Brody, the hero of Jaws.
There's a reason why we love actors that isn't talked about enough, and why a promise is broken whenever one of them dies. It's not that they're beautiful; it's that they're immortal. For two exquisite hours, we can be immortal as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ITALY
When digging a hole, the ultimate destination may be China, or, if you're more calculating, it's the showroom of Italian jeweler Dimiani. Sunday, seven men (who had been presumably digging a tunnel under the showroom for weeks) appeared from the cellar, tied up the staff and made off with a cache of jewelry. Unluckily for the thieves, many of Damiani's best pieces were in L.A., not Milan, loaned out for the Oscars. Italian police speculate it was an inside job. - Simone Landon

FRANCE
Ix-nay on the ublic advertising-pay, said French President Nicolas Sarkozy last Tuesday.  A commission will propose changes to state-owned France Télévisions by May, with complete conversion slated for January 1, 2009.  Advertising generates €800 million--forty percent of France Télévisions' annual income.  That cost may be offset by state subsidies and the sale of a public channel to private ownership. Said Sarkozy: "The abolition of advertising is the only way to instill diversity." He hopes the world will follow France's lead. - Paul Monnes

FRANCE
Though Sarkozy has a faint Jigga air about him--the aviator shades, supermodel wife, hip-hop producing son--he is far from being dubbed France's "first black president." In fact, there's not one black person holding a major public office anywhere in France, though it has Europe's largest West African population. Bloomberg.com reports that Senegalese immigrants are now turning their eyes to the US election and Monsieur Obama. French person: "[because] what happens in America ... happens 10 years later in France." - Robert Moor

NORWAY
In The Golden Compass, the Arctic island chain called Svalbard houses fearsome armored bears. In our reality, circa 2006, Norwegian scientists in Svalbard discovered the fossilized remains of an enormous pliosaur. Now, after a full excavation, BBC News reports that "[t]he monster" is "the biggest marine reptile ever known to science." Roughly bus-sized and with jaws three or four times as strong as a crocodile's, this sea monster could certainly have fought an epic battle with those comparatively cuddly Panserbj√∏rn. - Hannah Sheldon-Dean

CYPRUS
Cypress Hill's beef with Ice Cube is extremely minor compared to the territorial battle raging in the island nation of Cyprus. Newly elected president Demetris Christofias hopes to put an end to it by resuming negotiations around reuniting the split island. Though Christofias is the leader of the Greek Cypriot Communist Party, the election is not a turn to the red, but an affirmation of Christofias's reunification plan and his experience dealing with Turkish Cypriot trade unions and political leaders. - Simone Landon

ENGLAND
In an example of so-called "happy-slapping" incidents, largely unknown in America but all too familiar in Britain, Gavin Waterhouse, 29, of West Yorkshire, died of organ failure after being beaten to death by two strangers. In addition to the two perpetrators, a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl is charged with abetting manslaughter for capturing video of the assault on her cell phone and circulating it to friends. The unprecedented charge reflects Scotland Yard's crackdown on this teenage phenomenon of random acts of violence-as-entertainment. - Mateo Mancia

SWEDEN
Seventy-two fearless cichlid fish departed Esrange Space Centre in northern Sweden on Thursday to help with the study of motion sickness in space. Because the mechanisms involved in motion sickness are similar in both fish and people, researchers will look at footage of the fish hoping to explain why some people get motion sickness. Apparently our fishy friends suffer from a bone loss similar to osteoporosis out in space. Fish could help provide answers to counteract these effects of osteoporosis. - Daniela Postigo

KOSOVO
With the Beijing Olympics approaching, a handful of ethnic Albanian boxers from newly-sovereign Kosovo are hoping to compete. The International Olympic Committee called a Kosovo national team "unlikely," but may allow independent participation under the Olympic flag. If you thought the US hockey "Miracle on Ice" defeat of the almighty Soviets in 1980 was fraught with political symbolism, imagine Kosovar boxers pummeling opponents from, for example, anti-sovereignty Russia, who finished a strong second in boxing at the 2004 Athens games. - Zachary Rausnitz

SRI LANKA
"Did you hear?" Old Man Peters asked me.
"No," I said.
"There's a holy Banyan tree in Sri Lanka," Old Man Peters said, sighing. "The Buddhist monks love it because it sheltered the Buddha. It's the most heavily-guarded tree in Sri Lanka, to protect it from Tiger rebels. But I'll tell you what the monks didn't count on."
"What's that?" I asked.
"Monkeys. Monkeys everywhere." He paused. "You can't trust anyone."
I walked around crying. Old Man Peters was right. - Aaron Cutler

CHAGOS ISLANDS
Beginning in the 1960s, Britain militarily removed the inhabitants of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to make way for a US military base on the island Diego Garcia. Scant international media coverage by the BBC shows that four times in the past five years, the British High Court has unanimously ruled for the removal of these military bases, a ruling that has never been honored. The most recent court appeal, supposedly finalized on February 13, is still unreported. - Colleen Brogan

GUAM
It's a rare plastic army figurine collection that holds a B-2 stealth bomber. Most children forget about the bat-like plane they could use when the green figurines get boring; the aircrafts are ignored, hidden. But one blew its cover this past weekend by colliding with a different low-profile element of US society: Guam. The voteless, unincorporated US territory felt so ignored that the military accidentally crashed a $1.2 billion plane into it. The military grounded the B-2 fleet for inspection. - Jeffery Sanford

PHILIPPINES
A new dance has gripped the national psyche of the Philippines. What began as a semi-orchestrated game show shtick has metastasized into what some are beginning to think of as the new national boogie. With or without the accompaniment of the eponymous Papaya Song, outbreaks have reached pandemic proportions, and the craze threatens to jump to neighboring Taiwan. With a simple clap clap, shuffle shuffle, point point, you too can catch Papaya Fever. - Nick Greene

PAKISTAN
The Pakistani government got all insecure and created a black-hole in cyber-space. By accident or design, its short-lived national ban on YouTube over anti-Islamic film clips caused the website a two-hour global outage. Fobbing off reporters, a Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) spokesman claimed the ban concerned a trailer for a forthcoming Qur'an-phobic film by Geert Wilders, an unabashedly right-wing Dutch politician. A real shame that the PTA spokesman passed up a ripe opportunity to mention that Wilder's message might be as dubious as his outrageous bleached-blonde bouffant, as infamous in Holland as his rightist views. - Fawzia Mahmood

MYANMAR
The Voice, a Myanmar magazine subject to government censorship, has attacked Sly Stallone for looking like a fat lunatic in his latest movie. Rambo, the magazine insists, "looks funny fighting a war even though he's so fat with sagging breasts." The movie, which depicts the Burmese military's ongoing genocide of Karen tribesmen, and John Rambo disassembling said military with a machete, has become an underground hit in Myanmar and made Rambo a hero, despite the government's ban on the film. - Robert Moor

CHINA
The International Olympic Committee is taking credit for improving China's human rights record. According to the BBC, Olympic spokesman François Carrard is "convinced that when we look at this with the perspective of history we will see that the Olympic Games will have been an opportunity for considerable progress." If only the Olympic flame could cast its benevolent light on the other human rights-dubious nations of the world. Oh, IOC, please bring your beacon of goodness to Guantanamo in 2016! - Simone Landon

SOUTH KOREA
Kimchi is South Korea's beloved national dish, made from fermented cabbage spiced with red chili pepper. Thanks to monumental scientific advances, it's now safe to eat in space, which is good news for Ko San, South Korea's first astronaut, who will be blasting off on April 8. Scientists discovered how to prepare bacteria-free kimchi so that the cultures in ordinary kimchi will not mutate after exposure to cosmic radiation. I can see it now: Attack of the Killer Space Kimchi. - Audrey von Maluski

JAPAN
Oh, for a steamed sweet bean cake branded with the likeness of Barack Obama! To Japan, then, to a coastal town 300 miles north of Tokyo that claims fame for sharing the Democratic frontrunner's name. We'll sing "Obama is a Wonderful World" with members of the just-formed Group that Supports Barack Obama Voluntarily. We'll help them select chopsticks and lucky-wish dolls to send to Obama in the US, which lures its tourists with extinct birds and gigantic balls of yarn. - Katie Okamoto

TURKMENISTAN
A large cockroach made his rounds on a studio table during last Wednesday's broadcast of Turkmenistan's nightly news program Vatan, prompting the central Asian nation's president, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, to fire 30 employees from the main state television station the next morning. The station has not had a history of success, as Berdymukhamedov's predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, previously fired station executives after drunken technicians failed to broadcast his New Year's address. The whereabouts of the culprit roach were unknown at press time. - Shawn Ban

LEBANON
Apparently when filming rifle-wielding actors playing foreigners who accidentally start a factional war in Lebanon, there is--go figure--a real possibility of actually starting a conflict. At least, that is, if the set is a bombed-out hospital in Beirut and the actors are Lebanese Army veterans portraying members of Fatah al-Islam, a radical group the Lebanese Army has battled since 2007. Watch out, all you X-treme reality filmmakers: the Lebanese Army will storm your set demanding cameos and it will win. - Audrey von Maluski

MOROCCO
A Moroccan engineer was sentenced to three years in prison for creating a fake Facebook profile for Prince Moulay Rachid of the Moroccan Royal Family. The engineer says that the profile was a joke, like numerous profiles representing President Bush. He claims to have been blindfolded, spat on, and beaten unconscious while in police custody. The profile remained up at press time, with thirteen friends and the option to "poke Prince." Whether Facebook cooperated with Moroccan authorities is not clear. - Nathan Landers

SOUTH AFRICA
After No Country For Old Men won Best Picture and There Will Be Blood got a nod here and there for good acting or whatever, lots of people were bound to get all riled up about using guns. Come May 1, the 18,000-strong elephant population of South Africa (who for their part voted for Juno) will be legislated into hunting targets to lessen conflicts with humans and the environment. A single shot to the head from a helicopter was recommended. - Henry Freedland

KENYA
A prominent Kenyan physician expressed anxiety this week about the rising popularity of so-called "Obama" beer in Kenya, the birthplace of Obama's father. The beer, marketed as "Senator Keg" but known colloquially as "Obama," has become popular since the beginning of the US election cycle and is a staple beverage at primary-watching parties throughout the nation. Enthusiasm aside, critics like the physician fear that this aspect of Obamamania could contribute to the chronic alcoholism prevalent in Kenya's lower class. - Nathan Landers

MEXICO
Down to the Sea of Cortez in ol' México
Some twelve hundred tourists did venture to go
Till this Monday past, quite content were they
To plop prostrate top side where tanned bodies lay.
Then on day 10, disaster laid low
A near 10 percent--that's a full one-one-oh--
When a bug of the gut sent them to the ba√±o.
Hope for the sick ones? The worst is but two days
(Though rumor says skipping brunch is the trick that pays). - Chelsea Rudman

VENEZUELA
In an effort to halt what he considers another form of American imperialism, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is mandating policies that excise the English language from the country's business and culture. Venezuela's Communications and Information Ministry issued a statement this week calling on the technological sector to replace words like "meeting," "marketing," "password" and other commonly used English terms with their Spanish counterparts. Beyond the lexicon, Chavez seeks to counter the "dictatorship of Hollywood" by financing Venezuelan films and music. - Mateo Mancia

INTERGALACTIC
Boom! they said it went. Only there isn't any noise in space. Now well-equipped boats can shoot satellites out of space. Despite years of knowing Hollywood's lies inside and out, that's still how I imagine it: boom! The pictures in the major news outlets, always suckers for sensation, didn't help, either. Surrounded by miles of sea, an aircraft carrier is engulfed in the missile's plume of smoke. I'd bet you my grandpa still thinks the moon landing is something else. - Jeff Martin]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THE ETHICS OF GENETICS by Rohan Madamsetti</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No one knows how to save Cameroon's rainforest. Since 2001, Joseph Matta, the Cameroonian Minister of Forestry, has been trying to lease 2,051,000 acres of the Ngoyla-Mintom rainforest to conservation groups for the low, low price of $1.6 million per year--about five dollars per acre. Conservation groups that rent land in order to preserve it, like Conservation International or the World Wildlife Fund, are used to paying much less.

<!--more-->
But logging companies are willing to pay much more for the land, which doubtlessly holds large stands of valuable hardwoods. The Cameroon forestry department is in a fix: either rent out the land at prices far below its value to save it or lease it out for top dollar to the logging industry. The latter option would also generate jobs and improve the local infrastructure. But an unlikely idea may provide a compelling reason to save the rainforest: treating biodiversity as intellectual property.
The fundamental problem is that rainforest is dirt-cheap. The land itself is poor because all the nutrients in the soil are immediately taken up by plant and animal life. Once deforested, the land can't sustain farming or ranching unless more forest is cut down and burned to nourish the soil. What little topsoil is present is soon washed away by torrential rains during the wet season. The land is bad because its value lies in the life it supports.
Aside from the fact that the forest scrubs carbon from the air, effectively acting against the effects of global warming, rainforests happen to be the most lush of Earth's habitats, containing uncountable multitudes of life forms. At most, one percent of everything living in jungles worldwide has been identified, let alone characterized. When it comes to gene discovery and natural products research, the rainforest is a gold mine. Forty percent of all drugs used today are made by plants, animals and microorganisms found in nature. Examples include curare, used in heart surgery; quinine, the first anti-malarial discovered; and artemisinin, the hottest new drug to combat drug-resistant malaria.
Because biodiversity has never been quantified, there have never been good incentives for people, whether in large corporations or in indigenous tribes, to keep rainforest pristine and undeveloped. Already, more than 40 percent of the human genome has been patented by drug companies staking claims for their drug discovery efforts (and to prevent rivals from using 'their' data). Obnoxious as that may be, the ability to turn genetic information into cash might provide the proper incentives for corporations and countries to protect rainforest land.
Since no one invents genes, gene patenting is a strange idea. The legal grounds for the process have still not been worked out. By reserving the rights to a gene, a company can design drugs that target the gene, or use the gene to make industrial enzymes, without having to compete with rival firms. Often, billions of dollars are at stake. One of the major issues surrounding gene patents is biopiracy: the appropriation of biological knowledge from indigenous peoples or developing nations without adequate recompense. A decade ago, a challenge headed by the India-based Council for Scientific and Industrial Research led to the annulment of US patent rights over natural products taken from turmeric, a spice that has been used in cooking and traditional Indian medicine for centuries. (Curcumin, a compound found in the spice, is an anti-oxidant and also has putative anti-cancer properties.) While this may have been a victory against so-called biopirates, keeping such knowledge free means that companies and countries have little reason to protect the habitats these drugs come from.
A recent letter published in Nature Biotechnology entitled "Conserving biodiversity using patent law" outlines a novel strategy: list nature as co-inventor for natural products and invest one percent of all resulting proceeds in a global conservation fund dedicated to saving these resources. Drugs derived from cone snail venom have a conservatively estimated market value of $35 billion per year, while no more than $40 million per year has been allocated to save cone snail habitats. Destroying natural habitats like the rainforest comes down to destroying billions of dollars of potential earnings.
Clearly, much legislation needs to be done to manage gene patenting. But if done properly, perhaps the market can save what's left of the planet's resources, those which have not yet been ravaged in its name.
Harvard Professor George Church has made a career out of being a maverick. A geneticist who has dabbled in everything from genome sequencing to making synthetic organisms, Church's most recent project is the most controversial yet: he wants to sequence your genome, take your measurements, then put it all up--along with your name--on the internet for the public to see. This is the Personal Genome Project, and it might revolutionize patient care as well as our very understanding of the human race, albeit at the small cost of driving everyone's insurance premiums through the roof.
The project is still in its first stages. So far, 10 people associated with the program have had their genomes sequenced, and beginning this year, volunteers from the general public will enroll in the program after going through a rigorous consent process. As a collaborative effort between geneticists and the public, the Personal Genome Project is as much a social experiment as a scientific one.
Scientists like public information. The institution of science depends on professionals openly presenting data for peer review. Open access means that science moves faster. Church wants to take this philosophy to the next level by turning all of humanity into a dataset. It is true that the Personal Genome Project might violate the long-sacred rule of doctor-patient confidentiality by putting your medical records on the internet. But being able to compare your genome and records to everyone else's will provide unprecedented insights into the history and makeup of the human race.
For one, if taken to completion, the project could theoretically generate a complete genealogy for everyone on the planet, saving thousands of dollars in Mastercard purchases for the father and son who research their roots in Norway only to find out that they're Swedish.
As an added bonus, the enormity of the data also means that it can track the evolution and history of humanity without relying on the distortions of historical record (case in point: the kid is not my son).
The most pressing reason for the project, however, is that it could make it easier to spot the potential for certain diseases. There are only a handful of diseases--cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease among them--for which having a specific gene means that you will be affected. Usually, it's a numbers game: the effect of a gene depends on thousands of other genes, as well as environment and chance. Putting medical records and names to genomes puts a face to the trillions of nucleotides that collectively code for humanity; it allows scientists to see what happens when you put genes in action. The upshot is that doctors will be able to tailor their prescriptions and diagnoses based on your genome, opening up an era of personalized medicine.
That said, insurance underwriters everywhere will doubtlessly try to use the public data to cheat clients. It's foolish to think that insurers, who make money by insuring low-risk individuals, would ever want to insure someone who has an 80 percent chance of developing heart disease, or that an employer would want to hire someone with the gene for Huntington's disease, knowing that in 10 years he will need full-time medical care. The New York Times recently reported on the increased incidence of people who hide the results of DNA tests from their doctors and their insurance, terrified that the knowledge that they are more susceptible to cancer or lung disease might raise their premiums or cause a denial of coverage. Last year, by a vote of 420 to three, the House of Representatives passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which intends to protect Americans from discrimination by employers or insurers based on genetic test results.
The Personal Genome project is an excellent idea, but it is not going to be stomached  by a public used to keeping information that could be used against them as private and secure as possible. But it would be a complete shame if we missed out on the world's biggest chance to understand our roots and the causes of genetic disease.
It is important that anti-genetic discrimination legislation pass soon to protect the genetically vulnerable, because the insurance risks are far outweighed by the scientific and medical benefits.

		<title>CITIZEN SCIENCE: WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS SCIENCE WRITING?</title>
		<link>http://students.brown.edu/College_Hill_Independent/?p=38</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The public's knowledge of science relies for the most part on scientists, who are as well known for their eloquence as doctors are for their penmanship. But let's be fair. Some of the most celebrated books of the last 10 years have been scientific ones made accessible to a lay audience: their communication of technical science balances accuracy, precision and compelling language.

<!--more-->
Brian Greene, author of the popular The Elegant Universe, wrote in a foreword: "Non-scientists sometimes blur the distinction between the intimidating language--mathematics--in which physics is developed and the engrossing ideas with which it tussles. But that would be like my trying to read Huckleberry Finn in Greek." So Greene set out to explain the quest for a universal theory of physics with the straight-shooting speech of Mark Twain.
<strong>Get Smart</strong>
Greene and others like him have used good writing to move science into pop-consciousness. Dava Sobel, who spoke at Brown last week, is a renowned science writer who says that her latest book The Planets was written for "people who were not interested" in the solar system. (She was inspired when she discovered that her agent didn't know the difference between a solar system, a galaxy and the universe). Then there is John McPhee, whose epic Annals of the Former World got him a Pulitzer for turning hard geology into an American poetic narrative.
It is in the area of research science, however, that non-scientists seem to shut down. Specialized vocabulary and intimidating variables are often unexplained, and prior knowledge assumed, by scientific writers deeply immersed in familiar work. The effect of a scientific paper on an uninitiated reader can be paralyzing. For a long time, this criticism of scientific writing's inaccessibility has served as the excuse for public ignorance of cutting-edge research developments. But scientists acknowledge the exclusionary language of their profession and are making conscious efforts to reform their parlance.
The notion that science must be communicated accurately to the general public is a fairly new idea that has been underscored by global problems like climate warming, which require a cooperative understanding of nuanced concepts. The National Association of Science Writers, which was founded in 1934 to foster the dissemination and interpretation of accurate scientific information to the public as well as to guide professional science writers in their work, has taken on a special responsibility in our age of information proliferation and exchange. Journals like Science and Nature always run contextualized discussions alongside technical papers, with the rationale that scientific studies need to be analyzed and placed in social, economic and even moral terms in order to be useful. These solid efforts to communicate between scientific and non-scientific communities do not align with the popular criticism that biophysicists can't even spell "thesaurus."
It is not that scientists couldn't or shouldn't improve their writing. But given the improvements made to science writing, and to the ongoing disconnect between scientists, the public and policymakers, the scientific community cannot be expected to bear the burden alone.
<strong>Inconvenient truths</strong>
Just as poor science writing is acknowledged by the public, the public, in turn, is notorious for being alarmingly misinformed about--or, at best, unexposed to--key scientific concepts. To some extent, this is the fault of the division of disciplines in academics. In a structure in which subjects are partitioned and framed as if from philosophically disparate cultures, there is little likelihood that a science major and non-science major will independently contemplate the other's perspectives. In fact, in some academic climates, science and the humanities are erected at ideological odds.
At institutions like Brown, where cross-disciplinary dabbling is not required, the potential for isolation and ignorance would be great were it not for the diverse interests of individual students. On February 3, the Committee on Science and Technology Studies and the Cogut Center for the Humanities at Brown University sponsored four panel discussions on "The Politics, Ethics and Science of Food." The event, dubbed "Fishes and Loaves," brought undergraduates and professors across disciplines together to discuss regional issues relating to food. It showed the rewards of bringing science and the humanities together in academics as well as highlighting their accessibility to the public.
The ecologist James Lovelock wrote: "We have no trouble with the idea that noble entities such as people are made up from an intricate, interconnected set of cell communities. [But] it took the view of Earth from space... to let us sense a planet on which living things, the air, the oceans and the rocks all combine as one." In the universe, everything is part of a connected system. While it may be practical to have academic, focus, it is dangerous to hone in at the expense of peripheral vision.
<strong>Package deals</strong>
Scientific knowledge, as Al Gore has now beat dead, can be inconvenient. It makes models messy. It does not always fit into the agendas of policymakers, the lifestyles of individuals or the worldviews of scholars. It can contradict, complicate and interfere. But even when it is inconvenient, science--and its misuse--influences policymakers and voters every day.
It takes only a cursory glance at the relationship between government and scientists to see how fundamental science is to major political decisions. Communicating the scale of climate change and its implications to members of Congress, who by and large have no scientific background, has been like running through water. And there are less loaded examples: few developers and regional governments heeded the warnings of coastal ecologists and environmental engineers about the importance of wetlands to buffer storm surges. Then there is a perennial debate about the science of toxicity and acceptable levels for air, water and food, not to mention the mixed message delivered to the public about serious and minor health hazards. Of course, citizen activists, a galvanizing part of the legislative process, must understand enough about science to know when it's really worth hollering.
In the '70s and '80s, a remarkable effort by scientists, public servants and an informed citizenry created enough commotion about UV rays and skin cancer that chemical companies realized the damage their products made to the ozone layer was a liability. Since the ban of the damaging chemicals, the ozone layer has been on the mend. The world is seldom so lucky. Climate change is the obvious poster child for woeful inaction on the part of the American public and its government, despite climatologists' efforts to alert people to the urgency.
On a basic level, the nitty-gritty of scientific theory is not required to thrive in our quotidian world. Passengers don't need to understand how to navigate latitude and longitude to take a plane. It isn't necessary to memorize the special properties of water to ice skate. But the basics of climate science, toxicity tolerances and coastal systems are crucially tied to human safety. In this sense, knowing the difference between latitude and longitude is important, because it comes as part of an educational package. But it is worth pointing out that more important than knowing is caring to know.
<strong>Scientific civic duty</strong>
To say that science is poorly understood because it is poorly communicated looks only at one side of the conversation. Scientific knowledge should be thought of less as a lecture series and more as a seminar. One half of the responsibility lies with the citizenry to seek out science, to question the universe and be active participants as learners.
In this way, scientific ignorance has everything in common with political apathy. Democracy, we can all agree, fails without the interest and investment of citizens. If citizens of the US have the responsibility to take part in democratic processes, to be informed of elections, to vote and to be aware of current events, then citizens of the natural world are responsible for wanting to know more about everything.
It is up to scientists to write better and articulate their findings and conclusions; it is up to us to be active readers, seekers and googlers. Key political decisions about environment, health, agriculture and natural disaster (to name a few areas) cannot succeed without the inquisitive minds of responsible and engaged thinkers. That means taking off academic blinders, getting out of intellectual comfort zones and being willing to be confused.
<strong>Shock and awe</strong>
A reinvigorated sense of scientific civic duty has practical impact in terms of organizing and understanding legislation and navigating hot button issues. But there is also another effect: wonder. Science has a profound pertinence to life that, when realized, can knock socks off. As children, some of us are lucky enough to visit science museums where we can stand on scales and weigh in at 30 pounds, a change in relative reality so startling that it blasts through the limits of quotidian imagination. Those who grew up in suburbia know the rocketing sense of freedom when great mountainous horizons are seen for the first time, with all their pre-ancient stories rifting and faulting like sunsets.
There is a gilded moment at the end of Am√©lie in which a man, reading that the number of cells in his skull is greater than the number of stars in the galaxy, looks up in amazement. Being aware of the world from a wide variety of angles, of which science is only one (albeit an important one), makes living in the world more stimulating and more enjoyable. Active questioning and seeking answers about what's going on are requisites for dynamism in society. To put it another way, acute awareness of what surrounds us engages us in ways that simply living cannot.
Kurt Vonnegut famously wrote, "The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest." A man of his intellectual twinkle was well aware of the importance of questions, discomfort zones and citizenship. Expecting scientists to inspire the public to realize such wide-eyed possibility might be asking a little too much. Yet we expect them to tell us clearly what is happening--as we should. Now the second and more important step is that we ask them questions.

		<title>THE 68 MILE HIGH CLUB: VIRGIN GOES TO THE EDGE OF SPACE, FOR A PRICE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 23, a crowd gathered in the New York Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium to see the unveiling of the rocket that will bring them into space. Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic's inimitably ballsy CEO, and Burt Rutan, his aerospace designer, revealed the designs of SpaceShipTwo and White Knight Two.

<!--more-->
The first, a spaceship, will be carried by the second, an aircraft, to a launch altitude of 50,000 feet. It will then detach from the carrier and rocket through the atmosphere for a suborbital tour at 360,000 feet, where passengers will experience about four minutes of zero gravity, before returning to earth. The plans are based on Rutan's SpaceShipOne, the first privately owned craft to enter space, which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize by completing three trips to the edge of space. Test flights of SpaceShipTwo are scheduled to begin this summer, with passengers taking off as early as next year. Hundreds of people have already bought tickets, with deposits totaling $30 million. Peter Schultz, director of the Northeast Planetary Data Center and the NASA/Rhode Island University Space Grant Consortium, says, "For every kid, this is the main goal, aside from killing dinosaurs."
At the "Year of the Spaceship Party," the group of ticket holders and staff milled around the planetarium, a glass and steel box planted in the middle of Manhattan, cheering their plans with champagne. Branson wants to privatize a cobwebbed government sector and put space technology into the hands of entrepreneurs. The implications of private access to space make pulp sci-fi dreams seem cosseted and pansy. Branson's very real goals include a floating hotel in space and a hypersonic plane that would fly orbitally, crossing the globe in 90 minutes.
In the 16th century, when maps were constantly redrafted, Professor of Medicine Girolamo Cardano wrote, "Among natural prodigies, the first and rarest is that I was born in this century in which the whole world became known." Richard Branson sees himself as forging paths in space and leaving markers for the rest of the explorers, fortune-hunters and settlers.
<strong>As safe as planes in the 1920s </strong>
At the unveiling ceremony, the mutton-chopped Rutan said, "Our goal is making the spaceships at least as safe as the early commercial airliners which were introduced in the late 1920s." With eleven major airline crashes in the 1920s, this projection isn't all too comforting. When further questioned, he said, "Don't believe anybody who tells you the entry level of new space craft will be as safe as a modern airliner." Yet the plan does not seem hasty: Virgin Galactic representatives continually stress that this is not a race. Nevertheless, Branson did write a book called Screw It, Let's Do It.
At a personal spaceflight symposium in October 2007, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin said he would not go on a private suborbital flight: "I don't need that publicity anymore and I don't need that risk." Aldrin was the second man on the moon.
While testing a propulsion system last summer, three employees of Rutan's Scaled Composites were killed. The FAA said in 2004 that the Scaled Composites motor was "extremely difficult to ignite accidentally." Branson could be Queen Isabella to Rutan's Columbus. Or, SpaceShipTwo's crash could be a modern incarnation of the Hindenburg disaster, which ended travel by zeppelin in 1937. Or the more recent Concorde crash. But, as Schultz says, "If you're old enough, and have your will in order, my gosh, what a way to go out!"
<strong>Founders, Pioneers, Voyagers</strong>
The first creatures in space were mutts found on the streets of Moscow. The dogs, all mixed-breed bitches, were trained by the Soviet Space Program. Aside from street dogs and a variety of monkeys, only 453 people have ever been to space. The last time someone walked on the moon was in 1973. Branson says he's frustrated with this progress.
Schultz says that this frustration misunderstands NASA and its purpose, which is to explore. NASA, he claims, consists of visionaries: "What has driven a lot of science is coming up to the edge of reality and pushing it back further, and then further." NASA's focus is on gathering clues about the solar system and the origins of life, not ferrying people up into orbit.
Virgin Galactic has already confirmed tickets for 200 individuals, with 85,000 registrations of "interest to fly." The first customers are called founders, the next 100 are pioneers, and the rest are voyagers. At the NASTAR facility in Philadelphia, 80 passengers have already passed medical assessment and centrifuge training--including the 88-year-old James Lovelock, soundly putting to bed the legend of fervent astronaut fitness.
The ticket price is currently $200,000. At the unveiling party, ticket-holder Jean Ries of Luxembourg told The Guardian that though the ticket sounds expensive, "[r]eally, it's not much more than you'd pay for a very good horse."
Tony Earley, who was on the Concorde that broke the world speed record for circumnavigation of the world in 1996, says that as the airplane tore over Saudi Arabia, "I hoped there was someone down there to hear the shock wave chasing us through the middle of the night. Part of the thrill of going really fast, I suppose, is having someone else know you are going really fast."
There is a particular kind of schadenfreude that wants to punish people for wanting too much. One reporter from The Guardian grumbled that the Virgin Galactic flights were a good way to fire dozens of hedge fund managers into space.
But there are some for whom a trip to space will be more than a thrill ride, more than a cocktail party trump card. Stephen Hawking, who has been paralyzed since the age of 21, has already been offered a flight on Virgin Galactic. He says, "For someone like me whose muscles don't work very well, it will be bliss to be weightless."
Brendan Hermalyn is one of a handful of Brown students who has been on a zero gravity flight through a Space Grant competition. On the flight, the airplane plummets in spirals to create weightlessness. Hermalyn says, "It feels like you're swimming but without the water resistance."
<strong>Jumpers </strong>
The space technology is already being used to develop crafts to ferry people across the planet along the edge of the atmosphere. These regular hypersonic flights could potentially cross the world in hours. The hypersonic A2 jet, currently in development in Britain, would fly to Australia from Europe in less than five hours. Alan Bond, a senior engineer at Reaction Engines design, told The Guardian, "It sounds incredible by today's standards, but I don't see why future generations can't make day trips to Australasia."
This could create a class of elite daytrippers who can afford to hopscotch over the globe for business or pleasure, flying over vast tracts of technology-poor wastelands. For those who believe globalization exacerbates the world's inequalities, this form of transport is a nightmare. It would be, in a sense, globalization on crack. Globalization theorist David Harvey called the compression of distance "the annihilation of space by time... [so] the world seems to collapse inwards upon us."
In an article in Foreign Policy, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge scoff at negative views on globalization. They rely on refutation through stupefaction: "Nonsense." "Not really." "Wrong Again." "Not necessarily." "Nonsense on stilts." In their book A Future Perfect, they use the term "cosmocrats" to refer to those consultants, executives and money managers who take red-eyes and bump into each other at baggage terminals across the world. The authors present them as an "anxious elite," a class of people who are sleep-deprived and rootless. They are disconnected from both "ancestral loyalties" and their neighbors "around the corner." It is not customary to pity these people, leaning back in their first-class seats and drinking Blue Label as they hurtle through the sky. Still, the sense of perpetual homesickness and isolation is terrifying.
Virgin Galactic space tourism and suborbital flights can be compared to the peregrinations of the cosmocrats. The trips are sleek and streamlined, but they are disconnected--literally filtered--from the tactile world. Micklethwait and Wooldridge say, "A young example of the breed is often far better traveled than even the most wizened sailor that Joseph Conrad could invent. [But the] cosmocrats have no Conradian depth." On Virgin Galactic flights, passengers will be able to see entire weather systems and the blue curvature of the earth against the black meridian. They will be looking through porthole windows, and the images will also be shown on a screen in the front of the cabin.
With the legacy of our parents as a generation of backpackers--my dad rambled through the Irish countryside, my mom trekked down the coast of Greece--the idea of watching the view from your trip on an LCD panel is unsettling. It raises the idea of saving the 200 grand and getting a copy of Planet Earth to see these vistas, these expanses, this blue globe. With the money saved, you could buy approximately 20,000 compasses, 4,000 pairs of tennis shoes, 1,333 bicycles, 95 sunfishes, 33 Vespas and six hot air balloons.

<strong>Or you can take FLYNN BERRY B'08 on 888 dates.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>STEP INSIDE THE WONDERDOME: THE CHURCH, SUPERSIZED by Rob Moor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Megachurch. The word used to fill me with a peculiar mix of awe and dread, like 'Death Star' or 'tidal wave.' In the public imagination, the megachurch exists in a realm beyond rational understanding; it is large beyond description, tasteless beyond belief.

<!--more-->
Its adherents are the rapturous, sweat-sparkled, swaying masses and the occasional shrieking hysteric, seizing on the floor. I have seen it on late-night commercials for Christian rock compilation albums; I have seen it on the Trinity Broadcast Network. It was not until I finally saw it in person that I realized that the megachurch is not any more menacing than a traditional, un-mega church. It is merely the Anglo-European church made American: younger, faster, brighter, bigger, cheaper, less exclusive, more dynamic, more diverse and yet inexplicably more hollow.
A megachurch is technically defined as any church having more than 2,000 worshippers attending weekly services. They often employ multiple ministers, and many broadcast their services on television and the radio. That is about where the defining similarities end. The denominations range wildly--Presbyterian, Southern Baptist, Pentecostal, Black Methodist--as do their preaching styles. Joel Osteen runs Lakewood Church in Houston, the largest megachurch in the nation. His sermons focus primarily on self-improvement and moral rectitude, with little discussion of theology. New Life Church in Colorado Springs centers its doctrine on the need for religious people to engage in politics. Its lead pastor, Ted Haggard, is rumored to have a direct phone line to the White House, used to influence national and state elections and to speak with the President each week. If his name sounds familiar, it is likely because in November 2006 he confessed to purchasing methamphetamines while in the company of a male prostitute and later underwent therapy to 'cure' him of his homosexuality. Incidentally, there is even an LGBT megachurch: the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, which boasts more than 3,500 members.
As the second largest megachurch in the United States, the Willow Creek Community Church in Barrington, Illinois, is at the forefront of the emerging movement of "seeker-friendly" Evangelical non-denominational churches: Christian places of worship stripped of divisive doctrine, made flashy, attractive and huge. Each weekend, Willow Creek's 20,000 members commute from all over Illinois to watch a spiritually uplifting multimedia presentation bearing only a passing resemblance to an old-fashioned sermon. Interwoven into the performance are props, music, song and dramatic performance. Above the stage, it is projected onto twin 24-foot wide hi-def Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LCD screens, the same kind seen at sporting events and rock concerts.
Behind the glossy veneer of Willow Creek is a doctrine of inclusiveness bordering almost on conquest. The church's website states that the "mission of Willow Creek Community Church is to turn irreligious people [in the US and overseas] into fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ." What makes Willow Creek and churches like it revolutionary is the aim to convert not through fear of divine retribution, but through the sheer attractiveness of their message. By integrating rock music and film into the sermon, they have succeeded in appropriating and subverting the very aspects of our fast-paced, technologically dependent culture that the church once condemned.
In other words, fear not: the megachurch will not swallow you. If anything, you will swallow it.
<strong>Willow Creek ain't yo gramma's church</strong>
It appeared out of the midwinter Chicago sleet and fog like an aircraft carrier, long and flat and dark, composed of a series of interlocking rectangles. No cross, no steeple. I thought it looked like an Ikea superstore painted gunmetal gray. My friend, along for backup (should anything cult-y go down), said it looked like the Cobra Commander's headquarters, if GI Joe's enemies hid out in suburban Illinois. We stood a moment in the sleet, staring across a glistening prairie of midsize sedans and minivans, envisioning what wonders or horrors might be housed within.
When I was a child visiting my grandparents in Houston on Easter Sunday, the whole extended family--non-believing Yankees included--attended church services at the local Episcopal church. My memories are encapsulated in certain vivid physical sensations: the swelter of the stagnant spring air, the hard wood of the pew, the smell of the old Bibles and psalm books, the astringent swell of traditional hymns sung precisely, whitely. There was the hot feeling of disgrace each time the congregation rose to take communion and I, the only seven-year-old atheist within a hundred miles, was left sitting alone in my row. There was the choking cinch of my necktie and the hot itch of navy blue wool as I sat squirming in my Sunday best. Often I would awake with a start as my head slumped over onto the sweet-smelling shoulder of my grandma or aunt, who would frown down at me in a look of mingled disapproval and commiseration.
Acrid memories flooded back as I stared out across the parking lot. The un-steepled edifice represented an architectural rebuke to every visual cue I had learned to associate with churches and Christianity. And yet it still managed to fill me with that special dread I reserve for places of Christian worship.
<strong>No shirt, no tie, no exceptions	</strong>
With childhood memories in mind, I dressed 'appropriately' for my first church service in over a decade: button-down shirt tucked into khakis, an old Brooks Brothers jacket, brown leather shoes, hair smoothed down to one side. As we crossed the parking lot, I began to notice--with a sudden tug of dread in my gut--that everyone else, without exception, was dressed as though this was just another trip to the mall. They poured through revolving glass doors in their sweatshirts and jeans and Starter jackets and high-tops, while we strutted in looking like traveling salesmen or, worse, undercover journalists.
The relaxed dress code at Willow Creek is no accident, nor is it necessarily a reflection of the socio-economic position of the churchgoers. According to Forbes, in 1975, founder and lead pastor Bill Hybels walked door-to-door through South Barrington asking his neighbors what kept them from attending church. He then embarked on one of the most aggressive advertising and PR campaigns in recent ecclesiastical history, encouraging an informal dress code, replacing pews with movie theatre-style seats and holding services later in the morning. Willow Creek offered a more comfortable, entertaining and welcoming alternative to the traditional stuffiness of the community church. Almost overnight, the church became (quite literally) a monumental success, and has since spawned over 20 copycat churches nationwide.
<strong>Jesus on the JumboTron</strong>
The Main Auditorium of Willow Creek's sprawling complex is proudly billed as the "largest theatre in the US."  Riding the escalator to the uppermost mezzanine, we pulled open the doors and stepped out over a sea of 6,000 silent people, all with heads bowed. We had interrupted a moment of prayer for the survivors of the recent Northern Illinois University shooting. Unlike the church I remember from my childhood, which was plagued by dusty silences and stifled coughs, Willow Creek is rarely silent, even during prayer. Somber organ music bubbled out of a synthesizer piano onstage as we took our seats. As they prayed, I snuck a peek at the crowd, which had the exact casual deportment of a movie-going audience: calm, sated, a bit slouched, with creased brows and joined hands. The pastor raised his head, muttered a thousand-echoed "amen," and the sermon began.
The day's sermon, entitled "Trust Funding: a Revolution of the Heart," addressed the age-old theme of charity, but in a decidedly modern fashion. It began with a video featuring computer-generated text rippling over pictures of celebrities like Bono, Madonna and Brangelina while a hip, young-sounding voice asked pithy questions, like "Why do you give? Is it to impress your neighbors? Is it out of pity? Or is it because you want to be like the movie stars on TV?" As the video faded to black, a spotlight illuminated a mocha-skinned 20-year-old woman holding a microphone. She told a story about buying some powdered milk for a young street child during a recent trip to Nepal. Behind her flashed photos of Kathmandu while recorded voices, including that of the young Nepali boy, chimed in behind her. The story was frank, touching, shockingly well choreographed and only glancingly touched upon the Bible or God, with no mention whatsoever of Jesus. And it was all projected in radiant hi-def. I was entranced.
<strong>Planting seeds</strong>
Lead pastor Gene Appel then appeared on stage, wearing a lime green shirt with no tie. His pink scalp showed through a shiny tangle of thinning hair. In his left hand he held a blue plastic bucket filled with dry flax seed. Throughout the sermon, in which he compared giving to "sowing seeds with God," he would intermittently caress the seed, letting it sift through his fingers like sand. At one point he dropped four handfuls onto the stage to visually represent the four types of giving, which I no longer recall, but all of which started with a P. At the end, to the great delight of the crowd, he let loose a wild yellow spume of flax into the air, emptying the bucket completely, just as he said one is meant to joyfully empty one's coffers of time and money for the church.
The content of the sermon was staid, conversational and brief. His high nasal tone brought to mind Richard Dreyfus, and though the message didn't really resonate with me, whenever I became bored or irritated, Pastor Gene would catch my attention again with an amusing anecdote or a wave of the bucket. Interspersed with the moral prescriptions were moments of surprising candidness: he discussed his first divorce, his early money troubles, even his (reportedly, smokin' hot) sex life with his second wife. At the end, when his rhetorical bucket was empty, we prayed once again and filed out the doors as the speakers struck up the first chords of Supertramp's 1977 hit "Give a Little Bit."
<strong>Kingdom come</strong>
After the service, we explored the massive bookstore, the caf√© and the Visitor's Center, where I stood in line to meet Pastor Gene. He was exceedingly gracious, but without seeming, you know, too gracious. We discussed Providence, the ongoing genocide of Christian tribes in Myanmar and the merits of charity. Not once did he try to convert me. He just smiled sweetly with his crinkled eyes, chatted for a few minutes, told me he was glad to see me, shook my hand, and that was all.
Walking around the labyrinthine complex, I was surprised by the racial diversity of Willow Creek's congregation. The sermon was simulcast in Spanish, Chinese and Korean. Foremost among the non-white churchgoers were people of Korean descent. This probably should not have surprised me, as South Korea contains five of the world's ten largest megachurches. Topping the list are also megachurches in Nigeria, Chile, El Salvador, India and Argentina. Not one of the top 10 is within the United States.
The recent success of megachurches worldwide underscores one of their defining features: they spread. Willow Creek alone has five satellite churches scattered throughout the Chicagoland area and mentors over 11,000 churches nationwide on boosting attendance. Megachurches have founded their own schools, their own printing presses, even their own television networks. And while there are vast ideological differences between, say, a non-denominational Evangelical megachurch like Willow Creek and the radical, speaking-in-tongues First Pentecostal megachurch of Jackson, Mississippi, what all of these supersized churches hold in common is their desire is to carve out a larger space from what they perceive as an overly materialistic, shallow, debauched American culture. They hope to build a kingdom of the righteous here on earth, even if it's only as big as a city block or a basketball arena. In that endeavor, megachurches aren't all that different from the little Episcopal church I remember from my childhood. They're just carving off a bigger slice of the pie.

		<title>SOME BONDAGE, LITTLE RESTRAINT: THE SEX WORKERS&#039; ART SHOW COMES TO PROVIDENCE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More than a week after the sex workers came to town, I'm still not sure how I feel about them. This might or might not be their fault. The Sex Workers' Art Show--actually a cabaret review featuring readings, stand-up comedy and performance pieces, brought to you by an endearing assortment of strippers, burlesque dancers, porn stars and other professional titillaters--has been making its annual circuit for 10 years now. Presumably they've figured out what they want to accomplish and the best way to go about it, and ambivalence might indeed be the desired result. More on that in a minute.

<!--more-->
The performances on February 17 at the RISD auditorium, at any rate, showcased people who know their act well--maybe too well. More than a few components felt a bit rote; it was hard, listening to the wry stage patter, to believe that any part of it was spontaneous, or would be performed any differently the next night in another city. Some comics can give the same routine five nights a week and manage each time to make it sound like something that's occurring to them right then as they speak. I didn't know what to expect, exactly, from the Sex Workers' Art Show, but I suppose I thought the porn stars would be a little better at faking it.
<strong>Did I say something true?</strong>
The show, based in Olympia, has been playing more and more campus shows over the last couple of years, dragging a predictable and wearisome degree of controversy behind it. There's nothing to be said, really, about the recent debates and protests at schools like Duke and William and Mary, which were over before they even began. Portions of the Sex Workers' Art Show will offend you if you're of certain sensibilities or political sympathies--there's some mild nudity,  some cheerful profanity, and one instance of somebody writing "FUCK BUSH" across his torso in neon orange tape--but the show isn't dangerous in any meaningful sense. No one in the audience is encouraged to go to work in the sex industry, or made to feel bad for pursuing a liberal arts degree. The show's overt commentary on American society is obvious and daft, and the points that carry real weight are only cursorily addressed.
Most of the heavy lifting is done by Annie Oakley, the show's founder and director (her handle dates back to her early days as a stripper). Oakley contends in the show's introduction that we've allowed our collective eyes to glaze over when it comes to the products we consume, from fast food to fabrics to flesh; we spend money on these things, but we don't know or want to know where they come from. It's a good point, and one more squirm-worthy than any topless writhing or frank discussion of herpes simplex might be. Later, Oakley read an essay suggesting that what's morally objectionable about the sex industry isn't the work itself so much as the pitiless economic circumstances that railroad people--primarily women--into the business in the first place. The point has been made elsewhere, but I was glad to see it addressed here; it's the kind of thing that will take a lot of repetition before an electorate is moved to do something about it.
That's about as thoughtful as the Art Show gets, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; two hours of unalloyed sermonizing would have lost its charm quickly. It's possible that a more nuanced treatment of the politics behind sex work can be found in Working Sex, the Oakley-edited volume of essays by the likes of Stephen Elliott and Michelle Tea; this is the book from which Oakley's provocative reading was taken, and while the show wasn't created to promote the book Trojan Horse-style--Working Sex was just published this year--the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set up that way.
<strong>Naughty bits</strong>
But about the show itself: it was all right. Some acts were better than others. Erin Markey, a brassy young woman from Michigan, offered a delightfully unhinged monologue about graduating from college and finding work as a topless dancer named Saint Bridget. She capped off her segment with a neat, jazzy original number that she sang while giving the evening's most nimble pole dance. Amber Dawn, a Vancouver-based sex-education worker and author (and film star and performance artist; nearly everyone on the Art Show's bill carries this kind of hyphenated biography) read an engaging account of her own and friends' experiences with clients. Dawn's bearing was stiff and her cadence just a little off, and her slangy diction would have fallen flat on the page but for a narrative full of well-chosen details--I'll refer you to her description of a colleague's afternoon spent with men who "drum her face with their Viagra erections while reciting The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."
Not everything worked so well, least of all the acts that felt like something a high school student would have come up with if given the instruction "Be shocking." As the burlesque dancer Dirty Martini stripped away her outfit, more and more probably-not-actual dollar bills fluttered out; she crawled around onstage stuffing these into her mouth before reaching behind her and pulling a string of neatly folded origami knots from her thong. The whole thing was scored to "God Bless the USA." Presumably, the point of this piece was that Americans have too much money, or like money too much, or something. I was similarly unclear what we were meant to take from the big finale, featuring the breathy, bewigged East Village artist Krylon Superstar, who stripped, jumped into a wading pool full of glitter and stuck a lit sparkler in his butt. (Superstar was the one with "FUCK BUSH" spelled out in electrician's tape on his chest.) You might not need to be told that the music for this was "The Star Spangled Banner." The act might have been high irony from start to finish, I suppose--a winking parody of the kind of political histrionics that were an easy punchline 10 years ago--but congratulating oneself for getting the joke can offer only a temporary sense of fulfillment. And anyway, I'm not convinced that a joke was being made at all.
The evening might have been best summed up in the stage time allotted to Lorelei Lee, a porn star and college student who read some original fiction. Lee's loosely connected vignettes occasionally approached the transcendent, like when she described filming an orgy in the back of a limousine, the driver charting west for hours to keep the maximum amount of light in the shot. Just as often, they displayed what could be either an embarrassment of self-regard or a stunning lack of it, as when Lee's narrator is en route to a shoot, Sean Paul comes on the radio, and she tells us, "I want to hear a sad song." It's the kind of artless line, meant to convey world-weariness and depth, that you'd expect to find on a Deadjournal page somewhere. Lee, like most of the other performers in the Sex Workers' Art Show, is not without talent, but she'll need to spend more time sharpening her craft before she can be thought of as an author first and foremost.
<strong>It's not about sex, it's not about love</strong>
The publicity materials for the Sex Workers' Art Show state a few different goals for the show, some of which can't really be reconciled with each other. The most obviously tongue-in-cheek--"created by people who work in the sex industry to dispel the myth that they are anything short of artists, innovators, and geniuses!"--could stand to be done away with, as it's the kind of cheap, preemptive irony that educates precisely no one. I didn't see any innovators or geniuses at the Sex Workers' Art Show, although I did see a few people with a flair for storytelling and song, people who could probably make a living in some less heavily legislated industry if they really wanted to. If the point of the show really was to convince us that these specific performers are among the indelible talents of the twenty-first century, then it was not successful.
But if the point was to illustrate that sex workers are as human as the rest of us and experience their lives in the same complex, confused way that everybody else does--an honorable goal, and one worth pursuing, given the dopily reactionary climate that obtains in much of America--then the show did what it came to do. It was clear that the performers were by no means monsters, any more than they were geniuses. Rather, they were regular people with good intentions, doing what regular people do when they put on a show--make jokes, try to endear themselves, cram too many ideas into an hour, experiment with lots of different things and hit the mark about half the time. The central point here, that sex workers are people, isn't one that you'd think anybody would need to be told, but that isn't the country we live in. We're given easy stereotypes about wanton sin merchants or hookers with hearts of gold, but the reality is at once more nuanced and more boring. Profound ordinariness isn't the first thing you look for in an entertainer: we usually like outsized personalities to command the stage, people who come from a slightly different place from us schlubs in the audience. The Sex Workers' Art Show, then, is only intermittently successful as art. As politics, though, it might be the best thing we've got coming.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge </strong>
Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge, or The Flight of the Red Balloon, is Taiwanese director Hou Hsaio-Hsien's first foray into foreign territory. However, the French-language film, shot entirely on location in Paris with a French cast and crew, manages to retain Hou's characteristic sensitivity, spinning an elegant study of isolation and postmodern drift.

<!--more-->
Song, a young expatriate film student from Beijing, begins to babysit for Simon (Simon Iteanu), the reflective seven-year-old whose harried single mother, Suzanne (Juliette Binoche), is too busy rehearsing for a puppet show to care for Simon after school. Early on in the film, Song gingerly asks Simon whether he has ever seen a movie called The Red Balloon and then spends the remainder of the film making her own movie about a red balloon with her camcorder. Her film acts as a discreet foil to the more abrasive narrative of Simon's and Suzanne's fissured home life. An uncharacteristically blonde Binoche, with deceptive cleavage and outlandish clothing, excels in her turn as a hysteric harridan of a mother trying to navigate the pressures and demands of single motherhood.

Commissioned as the first film in a series funded by Paris's Mus√©e d'Orsay, Voyage is a diaphanous but finely rendered homage to Albert Lamorisse's beloved postwar short Le Ballon Rouge (The Red Balloon). Hou filters the child's perspective of Lamorisse's film through the pensive gaze of Song's lens. Song's perspective is implicitly Hou's own;  they are both foreigners in Paris and filmmakers exploring the intersections and divergences between Lamorisse's approach to the children's tale and their own.

The film's unhurried opening sequence, which calmly follows the meandering journey of the itinerant balloon in and out of several modes of Parisian transportation, yields to the dark interior of Suzanne's playhouse, bobbing marionettes casting Caravaggio-caliber shadows. Suzanne frantically personifies her puppet's character, crying, "I must find her, I must find her"--just as we, trapped in the dark puppet interior, must find the lost balloon.

Hou and his regular director of photography, Mark Pin Bing, manipulate the camera and characters like the marionettes Suzanne gives voice to, delicately navigating the narrative through a complex intertwining of the different strands that shape the lives of individuals. Like the Calder mobile hanging in Suzanne's apartment, the camera alternately dips and rises, catching the characters at various crossroads.

The titular balloon, a perfect vermillion orb, coasts sporadically throughout the film, descending like the Holy Spirit upon uncertain Haussmann rooftops, guiding the narrative. Challenging Plato's claim that perfect forms cannot be seen in daily life, the balloon, both ideal and intelligible, dances across the Parisian skyline. And while the film is explicitly an homage to Lamorisse's film, Voyage can also be viewed as an interpretation of the Allegory of the Cave. The cave's statues and shadows are deftly recreated in the puppet playhouse and Suzanne's cramped, warmly lit apartment. The ascension into the intelligible realm of daylight is exemplified by the headstrong balloon, hovering, peeking inside and knocking against the windowpanes.

Like other Hou films, Voyage experiments with a double narrative, a Russian nesting doll of fiction within fiction. Like his 1995 film Good Men, Good Women, which follows the story of an actress in her real life paralleled with the life of the character she plays in a film, Voyage challenges traditional narrative structure by acknowledging the subject of the film within the film. Several moments in the film expressly unmask the fiction. At one point, Hou deliberately dispels the film's digital illusion when Song explains to Suzanne that when filming the balloon, she dresses the person holding the balloon all in green because the color can be erased digitally, making it appear to be floating.

Like the prisoner who escapes the cave, we are privy to the different levels of perception through the different representations of the balloon. We see phantoms of the balloon in Song's film, the Calder mobile, the balloon's shadow on the apartment wall, the gold rings of a merry-go-round--chased, like the balloon itself, by children--and the impressionist painting of a red ball at the Mus√©e D'Orsay.

In the final scene, filmed at the Mus√©e D'Orsay, Simon and his classmates examine the Felix Vallotton painting Le Ballon (The Ball or The Balloon). Like the final doll in the narrative nesting series, this painting acts as a surface summary of the film's plot--a boy or girl chases a red balloon while two adults, "her parents" or "ghosts" as the children suggest, watch in the shaded distance. "Is this a happy picture or a sad one?" the curator asks. "Both," the children reply, "because it is both sunny and shaded." The curator continues, "Where is the painter? Where is he watching from?" "En haut" they all respond--from above. The camera pans upward, revealing that the auteur is indeed above, skimming the museum skylight above the children's heads. Gliding away from the window with the camera behind it, the balloon leads the audience over rooftops and into the sky, concluding the film as it began--an unhurried elegy to the lonely, too fragile to touch.

<strong>BOARDING GATE </strong>
The young female drug runner sits in the businessman's office. Their relationship is over, or so he'd like to believe. He says, "Remember that weekend when we went away and we made up a little game? You said you'd be my slave." She hikes up her skirt and starts to play with herself. "Say the word 'slave' again," she tells him. He pauses. "Slave."

This is one of two scenes that elevate Boarding Gate, a sweet-'n-sour cocktail the likes of which is rarely served. Sometimes Gate sprints breathless; other times it lingers over human perversion. The film shows shootouts in Hong Kong and switchblades in Paris, but it is at its best when it lets its two main characters loose upon each other in a room. Godard once said--or, at any rate, should have--that the history of cinema is of faces and voices. Gate has two of the most distinctive of each in recent film.

The rich man Miles's face and voice belong to American actor Michael Madsen. Madsen burst onto the scene in 1992's Reservoir Dogs, in which he sliced off a cop's ear while singing a pop song; his last notable roles came in Sin City and the Kill Bill movies. Madsen's gaze rarely wavers, nor does his voice rise above a pebbly purr--his characters are often crazy, but calm. Like fellow square-headed actor Michael Rooker, Madsen is too dangerous for American movies. Only Tarantino will give him good parts.

On the table sits Sandra, played by Asia Argento, also seen in this year's festival in Breillat's The Last Mistress. Argento, best known in America for her role in xXx, is the daughter of Italian horrormeister Dario; with her pale skin, hooded eyes and perpetual sneer, she looks like she belongs in a horror movie herself. Her English is so clipped that "hello" sounds threatening. Tattoos cover her body, and her nude scenes are among the film's few predictable moments.

Gate's plot details Sandra's involvement in a double-cross scheme planned by her current boyfriend (Carl Ng). Its heart lies in a long scene in which she goes to visit Miles at his home. We get handcuffs, asphyxiation and a hint of betrayal while she alternates between demanding passion and cash. Madsen and Argento seem like a lunatic pairing, but that's why they work well together--he's benevolent-violent, she's crazy-vulnerable. The scene ends with a twist that, though surprising, takes some of the juice out of the movie's latter half. The film begins to tighten around Sandra. Writer-director Olivier Assayas (Irma Vep, Clean) is adept with gritty stories involving women in trouble, but he has to work harder whenever he separates his leads. Yet, though much of its acting is flat and its dialogue wooden, the film is worthwhile for the star pairing alone.

Assayas litters Gate with violence and turbo-charges it with sex: a gun is as much of a phallus as anything, and even the film's title is a double entendre. Boarding Gate finally comes close to a good old trashy B-movie. If it were an American film, it would play at drive-ins; because it's a French film, it closes the festival. Say what you want about mixing high art and low art, but the festival programmers made a half-decent choice.

<strong>LES T√âMOINS</strong>
Les T√©moins, or The Witnesses, directed by Andr√© T√©chin√©, documents the bewildering onset of the AIDS crisis circa 1984 among a rather incestuous group of Parisian friends. They encounter the disease for the first time when the wildly attractive young Manu, who has just moved to Paris, becomes infected. Manu comes to be involved with Adrien, a gay older doctor who becomes masochistically infatuated with him. But by the time his symptoms develop, Manu is already entangled in a loaded web of sexual relations that encompasses the heterosexual open marriage of Adrien's friends Sarah and Mehdi, the platonic yet creepy relationship between Manu and Adrien and the torrid homosexual affair between Manu and Mehdi, one of those cops who is 200 percent straight. Part I, called "Happy Days, 1984," is loaded with bold color--bright pink walls in Sarah's apartment, the yellow flannel that Manu wears throughout and endless sunlight--that captures the intensity of feeling of the era. The tension created by the overload of color in Part I perfectly embodies the lack of inhibition in the pre-catastrophe world; it also foreshadows the tragic repercussions of such intensity, revealed in the dimly lit struggle of Part II, "The War."
The film's conceptual strength is its communication of the deeply rooted ambiguity at the heart of such a struggle. No character's reaction to the diagnosis is ethically irreproachable, nor totally unsympathetic--even Manu's golden-boy energy and good looks in Part I are mediated by an off-putting narcissism and snarky smile that prevent him from becoming a tragic hero. (As one of my friends put it, he's kind of sketchy and only has one shirt.) Adrien, meanwhile, comes into his own in Part II as a leading AIDS researcher in charge of Manu's treatment, but his questionable motivations, incited by the need to preserve control over Manu, complicate this altruism.
There's something a little too neat about the relationship setup, of course, which manages to throw in every type of character and relationship to somehow incorporate each possible demographic affected by the AIDS crisis into the film's six-person plot. Their relationships with one another are effectively played out, however, while the film reserves judgment. In bearing witness to the crisis in this way, the film makes its own suggestion for how traumatic events should be represented, while it acknowledges the inherent problems of this process. The ethical dimension of representation is most explicitly at issue in Sarah's decision to incorporate Manu's story into her novel, a narrative that she sees as her testimony to the event and that Mehdi calls rape--referring, we surmise, to the damage that would be done by its representational inaccuracy.
The problem of witnessing, as the film puts forth, is a lack of objectivity that is still at work in our reception of the AIDS crisis. It's bewildering to watch a historical account of the gradual onset of AIDS--the film does this well, showing excerpts from a PowerPoint lecture made by Adrien about the disease as well as televised accounts of its growing statistics in the United States--when the effect of this trauma on the cultural consciousness remains in many ways unexplained and unacknowledged. What the film bears witness to is not only the inescapable ambiguity of witnessing, but also a certain resistance to bearing witness, a failure it makes clear is innate to human nature.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have only general impressions, now, of the first time I saw Providence: the stark outline of the Bank of America building coming into view as we drove north on I-95, then the narrow one-way streets and brick facades along the canal. These things have had time to become familiar to me, and I've been acquiring stories about them along the way--a personal mythology of the city as I know it, at least as much of it as I know. The Providence other people know is different from mine, constructed out of their own experiences with these same city streets.

<!--more-->
Tim Devin, a conceptual artist and writer from Boston, likes "to compare how different people relate to the same public space." His art/book project "The Last Time I Saw..." draws together the experiences of about twenty Providence residents, gathering personal stories and mapping them onto the points in the city where they took place. "Public spaces have secret meaning for people," says the website for "The Last Time I Saw...." "Most of these associations are positive or neutral; others are decidedly negative." The map that Devin makes of Providence articulates the less cheerful memories: the points on the map indicate the last place the stories' writers saw someone who was important to them, someone they no longer speak to. Devin describes the project as both a forum and a memorial for these experiences, a cathartic space for sharing the feelings of loss that our geography won't let us forget.
<strong>Lost and gone forever</strong>
Devin's own "Last Time I Saw..." experiences inspired the project. Devin told me about a night last year when, by chance, he ran into two "former life-long friends." Although they've since gotten back in touch, for a long time afterwards, those places where he had seen them were painful reminders of how much things had changed. "The Last Time I Saw..." started as a conversation among Devin and his friends about people they were no longer in touch with and the places they associated with them. "In talking to other friends about it, I realized that everyone has had a similar experience. Only, no one talks about them. So it was therapeutic for [us] to be able to talk about our experiences."
Devin decided to expand the project and reach out to more people--to turn it into a public forum for people to share their stories and hear about others' experiences "so they could realize they weren't alone." His own friends and friends-of-friends were reluctant to contribute to the project, perhaps because they didn't want to share highly personal experiences with someone they knew. Devin put up flyers, posted on Craigslist and made a MySpace page to solicit "Last Time I Saw..." stories. "This is where most of the stories came from, from people I'd never met before." The anonymity of it was appealing--the freedom to put stories out into the world without ever having to admit to writing them. Out of the twenty-odd stories currently on the website, eight are anonymous and many more are signed with only a first name or initials. Devin said some of the writers told him that it was the first time they had shared these secrets with anyone. His project had become a confessional as well as a forum.
But "The Last Time I Saw..." is also a tribute to the past, memorializing the people who have fallen out of the writers' lives. These are painful memories, of ex-lovers, estranged family members, and the occasional tragedy: "The last time I saw him, he was a few weeks away from overdosing on heroin, in a room by himself" (an anonymous contributor).
The majority of the stories, though, deal with the simple inevitability of lives diverging as people grow up, move away and move on. "Either they pretended that they didn't know us, or they really didn't remember who we were. But I think that they did, and maybe just felt really awkward. But it was kind of an awkward moment because I was excited to see them and gave them a big hug and they didn't really have the same response. So I just kinda said, 'Well, it was good to see you,' and walked away" (anonymous). It becomes evident in Devin's project that sometimes people don't mean to lose touch, but when it is too much work to maintain an acquaintance it falls by the wayside--and that is its own certain kind of tragedy.
"The Last Time I Saw..." doesn't judge or qualify the writers' experiences in any way; each location is marked on Devin's map of Providence with an unassuming red arrow linking to the story. That the stories are pinned to points in space as well as in the writers' emotional landscapes makes the project a compelling artistic and urban experiment, not just a PostSecret knockoff.
<strong>X marks the spot</strong>
I couldn't stop reading the stories on Devin's website because I had been there, I had been to the Whole Foods on North Main Street and the Avon Cinema. These pieces made me think about the secret significance of the rest of the city that I live in, and the ways that people experience and imagine it. Devin told me he hoped "that mapping these stories would make people not involved in the project realize that public space has special meaning for everyone around them."  Any square of sidewalk could be important to one of the hundreds of people who step on it every day.
A city is never just infrastructure and architecture; it is a repository of memories, and Devin's project articulates just one facet of this complicated relationship between people and their surroundings. The stories are anchored to real places on the map, itself a two-dimensional representation of the three-dimensional space and the complex reality it recollects. A traditional map is a static, geometrically accurate depiction of space, though it need not adhere to those limitations. Some maps, called cartograms, substitute another thematic variable such as travel time or population density for area, resulting in a distortion of space that expresses such information; subway maps often show the relative positions of stations rather than their geographically correct locations. Even familiar, spatially accurate maps often express abstract ideas: what is a border or the name of a mountaintop if not made up, somehow artificial?
Still, a traditional map is hardly the definitive representation of a city, even if it is probably the most useful for getting around. I know the map of my imagined Providence is hardly to scale; anyone else who might use it would get hopelessly lost. Perhaps the stories in "The Last Time I Saw..." constitute a map that is every bit as valid as a geographically accurate chart--a narrative, emotional map, rather than a visual and spatial one. And by linking and layering this kind of map with the traditional kind, "The Last Time I Saw..." approximates the lived reality of Providence much more closely than a page in an atlas ever could. Devin's attempt to give expression to the emotional side of a city is an ambitious undertaking, but one of the reasons he chose to base the project in Providence rather than Boston, where he lives, was a matter of scale: "partly it was because Providence is smaller than Boston, and I hoped I could map a larger percentage of the city, and make the project more complete in that way."
"The Last Time I Saw..." consists of more than the interactive online map. The final version of the project involved the distribution of a free book of the stories and accompanying  maps that Devin handed out to passerby and left around Providence last summer, as well as a walking tour. Devin led the tour as part of Provflux 2007, the annual conference of the Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies (PIPS). After reading the first few stories aloud at their corresponding locations, Devin invited others to take his place. "Since they were all first-person stories, I like to think it made the stories more universal, and helped the volunteers step into other people's shoes, and experience the stories that way," he said.
<strong>Beneath Kennedy Plaza, the beach!</strong>
The walking tour allowed people to assume, momentarily, another perspective of their city--someone else's impression of Providence. This direct engagement with the stories and the surface of the city on which they are inscribed was an appropriately psychogeographic undertaking for Provflux. Guy Debord, a founding member of the Situationist International and a leading theorist of psychogeography, defined the term as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals." A map is clearly a "conscious" way of  giving order to the environment; Devin's project evokes a psychological landscape, exploring the way that the physical features of a city act as emotional cues.
But psychogeography is also about finding the productive link between the concrete and abstract in urban space and making positive changes in the social fabric of a city. Devin's project tries to effect such a change by asking people to consider how interpersonal relationships are mediated through public space. Devin "hoped that maybe ["The Last Time I Saw..."] would inspire some people (both storytellers and readers) to get back in touch with people they no longer spoke to." He  told me about one woman who had started to write a story about the last time she had seen her cousin "but then ended up calling him up, and now they are back in touch." In the end, "The Last Time I Saw..." isn't about last times so much as it is an attempt to humanize the built environment: Devin's project is driven by the optimistic belief that through shared experience, urban alienation can be overcome.

		<title>MAKING MEANING OUT OF STARDUST: INTERPRETING THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK TODAY</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I would like to think that had I come of age in the 1930s, I would still love the Gershwin, Arlen, Porter and Rodgers tunes that I swoon over (however self-consciously) today. But I'm incredulous. I can't deceive myself: it wouldn't be the same.

<!--more-->
The Great American Songbook is a body of music whose most prominent advocates unfailingly articulate their praise in terms of such technical details as harmony, melody, puns and double entendres. Yet as I listen to the Hoagy Carmichael disc from the Smithsonian American Songbook Series--one of the collection's 24 out-of-print titles that I recently splurged on at Ebay--I'm continually reminded of the contingency inherent in the meaning we construct about our experiences listening to music.
As an amateur scholar of American vernacular music with some background in music theory, I hear a lot in Frank Sinatra's version of "Stardust" (originally "Star Dust"), the first of 20 Carmichael compositions on this album. I hear the faint tape hiss of a track recorded in November of 1940; the irrepressible personality of Sinatra himself, even in this early incarnation with Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra and backup harmonies from the Pied Pipers; the melody--paradoxically neither hummable nor memorable, yet irresistibly beautiful; the form (abridged by Sinatra here to only the admittedly long chorus); and the harmony, of which I've acquired a cursory analysis from Alec Wilder's standard text-turned-collector's item American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900-1950.
But I also hear much that no one could have in 1940: Willie Nelson, who recorded an idiosyncratic version of it for his own remarkable songbook album of the same name; Woody Allen and his nasal voiceover, recalling his emotive use of a Louis Armstrong recording of the song in his 1980 film Stardust Memories; a song that a quick stop at Wikipedia will verify as one of the most frequently recorded of the 20th century but that a survey of my friends will reveal is obscure, despite a hint of familiarity with the title; the irony and alienation in romanticizing a self-portrait of another era that was nostalgic in its own time; my own solipsistic, hyperactive self-consciousness. Of course, I don't hear anything of those things--rather, how I interpret what I do hear is inseparable from them.
In high school, when my devotion to popular music was crystallizing as an identity, I was sympathetic to cries against this sort of listener-response perspective on music. It didn't seem right that I should disdain catchy pop tunes by *NSYNC (or Led Zeppelin, for that matter) primarily for their association with repulsive culture. It wasn't that I didn't want to be snob--if anything, I wanted to be a better one. At the time, though, I thought that meant not only retaining exclusionary historical knowledge, but also erecting a facade of objectivity around taste with the notion of disinterested aesthetic judgment.
As I've aged, however, and seen my own perspective on all sorts of music change (while the sound waves themselves have remained permanently fixed, etched on polycarbonate plastic discs), the possibility of hearing any music in figurative isolation or detached from extra-musical prejudices has lost its former plausibility. The experience of listening to music is not merely an instinctual sensation; hearing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony or "Fergalicious" consists not only of inner ear hair fibers detecting membrane vibrations caused by the pressure of atmospheric particles. Nor is it explainable purely in terms of prior auditory conditioning. My love of "Good Vibrations" can't be reduced to my previous exposure to the standard chord progressions of western harmony.
Yet if this might lead some to a terrifyingly uncertain, almost nihilistic relativism, it has for me been exhilarating. It is a frame of mind that has imposed upon my own listening a liberating demand for intellectual and emotional honesty toward music and its inextricably social nature. It's not that there aren't qualities to recordings that are outside each listener's subjectivity--it's that these never approach the totality of his experience, nor can they alone ever create 'meaning.'  The entries in that problematic category owe to how a listener such as me mediates between many layers of understanding, before that information is converted to judgment.
My reaction to the music of Tin Pan Alley, the fabled songwriting strip on West 28th Street in early 20th-century New York, appears to be a kind of transcendent synergy; it arises from a confluence of context-dependent values and impressions that together affirm the experience and, by association, the content itself--and perhaps even lend the latter an illusion of timelessness. If asked to defend the merits of "Stardust," I might take a page out of Wilder and tell you about the F-minor chord melody in the fourth measure, rattle off the manifold popular cover versions or analyze the deft fusion of European art music and American pop imbedded in the song. Or, to make it clear how perfect the song is for someone who constructs romance, nostalgia--any meaning, really, from music, I might quote the Mitchell Parish lyric: "Sometimes I wonder why I spend / The lonely nights / Dreaming of a song... Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain / My stardust melody / The memory of love's refrain."

<strong>BEN EWING '08 is in the stardust of the song.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Clemens at the Canseco party: the hidden transcript</strong>
"Clemens has repeatedly denied being at Canseco's house... But a young man has a photo of Clemens at the party... The man was just 11 years old at the time of the party, taking photos of various baseball players in attendance."
-"Report: Man has photo of Clemens at disputed Canseco party," posted February 22, 2008 on espn.com.

<!--more-->
(June, 1998. The Canseco home in Miami, FL. The cool atmosphere is luxurious, and the evening air is rich with the balmy scent of make-believe. This is summertime, a fun time, a child's time. A Child enters by the poolside, holding a disposable camera. His eyes are wide with admiration. He trips over a paper lantern. It is the day before the Toronto Blue Jays open a series against the Florida Marlins, and The Child is stunned by the sight of his heroes. Gary Sheffield, Ivan Rodriguez and Felipe Crespo walk by, their arms around beautiful women, rapt in conversation with Vanilla Ice. The Child knows that he may never have it this good again, and he sets to work, taking photos of baseball players, supermodels and future VH1 stars. Roger Clemens enters, unshaven, holding a martini.)
The Child: (excited, his heart full of hope) Excuse me, mister, can I take your picture?
Clemens: No. (Clemens shoves The Child.)
(Jose Canseco enters, surrounded by women. His arms are full with alcohol and his neck with gold chains. Derek Jeter sulks off to the side, upset with Canseco for stealing his girlfriend. Canseco sees Clemens, waves to him and belches. The women murmur with approval. Canseco pats them on the butt and sends them back to Hugh Hefner. He approaches Clemens.)
Canseco: Hey Rog.
Clemens: Hey.
Canseco: Thanks for coming.
Clemens: Sure. Glad I'm not pitching tomorrow.
Canseco: There's a game?
The Child: (rising) You're a mean man, Roger.
Clemens: (starts bending his knees, then stops once his back hurts) Hey, kid, do you have four Cy Youngs?
The Child: No.
Clemens: You ever been to the World Series?
The Child: No.
Clemens: You gonna sign with the Yankees next season for more money than God?
Canseco: (whispering) Hey not so loud, I'm probably doing that, too.
The Child: No.
Clemens: Then shut it.
(Brian McNamee, Clemens's trainer, enters. He carries a backpack, out of which pokes a needle. He glances around.)
Clemens: Brian, man, am I glad to see you! (He slaps McNamee on the back, acting jovial and manly.) Hey, let's go some place where we can talk. You better keep your trap shut, by the way. I hold no loyalties--just ask the Red Sox. Thank God nobody's recording us in case I need to lie in court about being here, eh?
(Canseco dawdles off to kiss a girl in a bikini. His wife and Clemens's discuss breast implants in the background. Clemens and McNamee walk arm in arm. The Child has hurt in his eyes and fire in his belly. He raises the camera and takes a picture.)

<strong>Footballer goes mental</strong>
Football in the UK is not all David Beckham and roses. On February 21, British football legend Paul "Gazza" Gascoigne, 40, who rivals Beckham in talent if not in poise, was arrested and committed under the Mental Health Act. Though nobody could say they didn't see this coming for the troubled former Newcastle United player, few offer anything but well-wishes and prayers.
Gascoigne was arrested at a Gateshead Hilton Hotel on February 20 following an incident at the Malmaison Hotel in Newcastle, where he had been living for two weeks while recovering from hip surgery. When a fire alarm went off at 3:00 AM, Gascoigne refused to evacuate, leading to an altercation with the night porter. The British papers have since implied that other allegations from hotel guests factored into his arrest, including reports of wandering the hotel with battery-operated talking toy parrots and answering the door in scandalous states of undress.
Britain's Mental Health Act, introduced in 1983, gives the state legal permission to give compulsory treatment for mental health disorders, which can range from a psychopathic disorder to temporary but severe mental impairment. Patients can legally be "sectioned," or committed, only if they pose a danger to themselves or others and are refusing treatment. Though Gascoigne was sectioned for 72 hours, he decided to stay at the hospital indefinitely in hopes of confronting long-standing drug and alcohol abuse, as well as alleged paranoia.
The Mirror reported that leading up to his arrest, Gascoigne was spending ¬£2,000 a day on cocaine. This figure makes fellow Brit Amy Winehouse, whose husband Blake Fiedler-Civil recently bragged to tabloids that he and Amy would spend ¬£500 a day on drugs, seem restrained. In his defense, Gascoigne used less than a tenth of his purchase. He would cut 35 lines at once and snort only the 16th and 19th, a tribute to the numbers he wore for the Italian club Lazio and for England during the 1990 World Cup--a testament to his mental illness.
A decidedly brilliant international player, Gascoigne is often credited with reviving his generation's interest in the sport. The midfielder scored 10 goals in an England jersey, and former England manager Graham Taylor called him the best player he's coached in international play. A photo of his tear-streamed face after receiving a yellow card at the 1990 World Cup remains one of the most iconic images in British sports.
But Gascoigne struggled with alcoholism publicly for the second half of his career. Nightclub injuries and tabloid headlines kept him off of the 1998 English World Cup team, and he never seemed to fully recover. He floated between minor clubs in England and China before retiring in 2003; he then took a stab at coaching and managing but was fired for showing up to games and practices drunk. His 2006 autobiography chronicles prolonged drinking binges and spouse abuse. After celebrating his 40th birthday in May 2007, he underwent emergency surgery for a perforated stomach ulcer likely tied to his drinking. But despite nearly 10 years of media scrutiny for his self-destructive habits--and 10 years of his self-destructive habits themselves--coaches, managers and players he has worked with in the past have come out in droves this week to voice their hope for Gascoigne's swift recovery.

<strong>NBA trade deadline: how the west will be won</strong>
Last Thursday marked a busy NBA trade deadline, headlined by perennial All-Stars making their way to championship contenders in the ultra-competitive Western Conference. Shaquille O'Neal (aka The Big Living Moss) was easily the center of attention, traded from the Miami Heat to the freewheeling Phoenix Suns, who have one of the league's best records at 39-19. As much as his mobility might be a problem, his fat, creaky, 35-year-old corpse will provide an interior toughness that is invaluable in the playoffs, when the tempo slows down and easy rebounds are scarce. The Suns also shipped the sulking Shawn Marion and the little-used Marcus Banks the opposite way. After seeing Marion disappear in crucial playoff games, the Suns management had an argument for trading him. The trade was still a shock, breaking up the high-octane squad that led the Suns to 60-plus wins in two of the last three seasons. Suns general manager Steve Kerr said it best: "If it works, I'm a genius. If it doesn't, I'm a moron." They are 5-5 since Shaq arrived.
More blockbuster trades happened across the conference, as the Los Angeles Lakers upgraded their frontcourt by stealing Spaniard star Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for the underperforming Kwame Brown and rookie guard Javaris Crittenton. The trade marked the biggest heist since Peter Minuit's purchase of Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets; the Lakers obtained the Grizzlies' best player without losing any of their core players and sparked outrage among the league's other general managers.
Meanwhile, the Dallas Mavericks improved their backcourt by obtaining star guard Jason Kidd from the New Jersey Nets. The trade, pulled off after several failed attempts, came at the price of up-and-coming Mavs point guard Devin Harris. It also marked a full circle for Kidd, who began his career with the Mavs in 1993.
In the less raucous Eastern Conference, only the Cleveland Cavaliers made significant changes among playoff-bound teams. A three-way trade saw the Cavs acquire forward Joe Smith and four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace from the Chicago Bulls, along with guards Delonte West and Wally Szczerbiak from the Seattle Supersonics. Wallace and Smith add rebounding and consistency to the Cavs' frontcourt; Szczerbiak adds three-point shooting; all three add experience. They are all over 30, though, and their play has declined as they've aged. Although the trade addresses some of Cleveland's on-court weaknesses, its real raison d'√™tre was to assuage franchise player LeBron James, who had been making increasingly loud complaints about the quality of his teammates. James will become a free agent in 2010, and the Cavs' front office is desperate to show that they are doing everything they can to help him win a title.
All in all, it was a hectic couple of days, especially after last year's snoozer of a trade deadline, which saw only bench players change teams. Rightly or wrongly, many of the Western Conference powers believed that their windows of opportunity to win a championship were closing and swung for the fences in the hope that a trade might lead them to the next level. May's playoffs will be one of the most anticipated in recent memory, with fans eager to see how this Cold War-style arms race will play out.

		<title>IF I HAD A ROCKET LAUNCHER: WAR GAMES FOR CAMBODIA&#039;S TOURISTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The commando waited until we had driven several miles beyond Thunder Ranch before he turned to me from the front seat and asked, "You want to shoot the gas?"

<!--more-->
"The gas?" I asked.
Paul, the plump Cambodian university student who had hired himself out as my guide, explained that he was referring to a tank of gasoline.
"Booom!" our driver rumbled. The commando smiled at him and then looked back at me, waiting.
Paul had brought me to the Thunder Ranch shooting range, saying it would be the highlight of my trip to Phnom Penh. He had told me I could fire a rocket launcher, and how could anyone pass that up? At the range, we were to meet up with the 911 Paratrooper Commandos, the team who ran the Ranch and who would teach me everything I needed to know to pull a trigger. But before driving the 30 miles out to the Ranch, Paul made sure I stopped at the ATM downtown. "How much should I take out?" I asked.
"A lot," Paul said.
The muscled commando who had been assigned as my trainer must have known about my wad of cash; ever since our introduction he had been offering me more things to buy. Did I want a beer? More guns? A T-shirt? And now, as we drove from Thunder Ranch's small arms firing range to the more spacious field used for detonating explosives, the commando was offering to sell me a tank of gasoline to blow up with a rocket launcher.
"How much is the gas?" I asked him.
"One-fifty."
With what I had already shelled out on the rocket launcher, I wouldn't have had enough cash for the gas.
"That's kind of expensive," I said. "Maybe not the gas."
"What about the chicken? You want fry a chicken? Fifteen dollar."
But exploding chickens--someone back home would object.
"No, thanks. I'll pass on the chicken."
We drove for a few more minutes and to satisfy my curiosity, I asked, "I hear you can shoot a cow. Is that true?"
Other travelers I had talked with had a lot to say about blowing up cows in Cambodia. Many say it's all a tall tale; others insist it's done all the time.
The commando thought for a minute, then turned to look at me. "Two five hundred," he said, counting out on his fingers.
"Twenty-five hundred? That's crazy."
"Yes. We buy the cow first." He motioned with his hand to the livestock grazing near the farmhouses we passed. "And then you explode it."
<strong>Rockets into Riel</strong>
Cambodia hasn't exactly been a stranger to explosions, invasions and other terrors during the last century. Occupied by France (1863-1941), Japan (1941-1945) and France again, Cambodia won a 1953 independence that was soon followed by American carpet-bombings during the Vietnam War. The genocidal Khmer Rouge regime marched on the capital in 1975, and Vietnam invaded in 1978. This occupation resulted in a decade of multi-faction civil war in the '80s, sustained by military support from the Soviet Union, the US, Vietnam, China and Thailand. This in turn led to the proliferation of landmines and small arms in the country.
In the early '90s, treaties were signed and elections held. The country is now trying to draw in tourists: luxury hotels are built near the Angkor temples in Siem Reap, US dollars are accepted everywhere and English-speaking taxi drivers are everywhere. The tourist boom has left small arms at the point of divergence between Cambodia's violent past and its opportunistic present. Groups who see them as war relics have worked to rid Cambodia of the weapons. Since 1998, the Working Group for Weapons Reduction (WGWR) has helped destroy over 200,000 small arms, thus promoting "peace and safety for all people" in Cambodia.
But entrepreneurial groups have used the weapons to court tourists. By stockpiling a collection of small arms and setting up firing ranges like Thunder Ranch, underpaid soldiers can look forward to dozens of tourists a day, each shelling out hundreds of dollars to fire off a few rounds. The PR-conscious King-Father Norodom Sihanouk boarded up the firing ranges earlier this decade, driving them underground. Now the only way to find directions is through unofficial channels such as guesthouses, bars, internet cafes or any crowd of taxi drivers loitering on street corners.
<strong>You want to shoot something?</strong>
We had driven the 30 miles out to Thunder Ranch on Paul's motor scooter. Covered in dust from the road, we stepped underneath the shade of a large, open-walled firing shed and saw a half-dozen or so paratrooper commandos loitering around tables, playing cards and drinking beer.
The oldest and fattest of them saw us enter the shed. He left his group and lumbered over. Ignoring Paul, he smiled and welcomed me to Thunder Ranch, yelling over the machine gun fire. "You want to shoot something?"
"Yeah, sure," I said, holding my ears.
I reached for a handshake but saw his crippled right hand limp by his side. He shook with his left and then motioned to the rows of guns pegged like trophies on the wall behind my back. "We have many, many guns. You can choose."
Another commando came from behind his boss and presented me with a laminated menu of weapons and their prices. The boss glared at me intently, waiting for my order, waiting for me to pick a handgun or two as an appetizer.
"I was looking to shoot a rocket launcher," I said, seeing only smaller-gauge weapons.
His eyes lit up and he turned the menu over. The rocket launcher was at the very bottom of the list.
I wavered at the price. "Are you sure about this? I heard it was cheaper."
"No, no my friend. Cheaper, you only shoot one of these things." He fingered a smaller machine gun, twiddling the muzzle dismissively. My hesitation seemed to irritate him.
I considered that I had been living more cheaply than ever for the past few days. Food cost a penny, and hostels were a bargain. And I couldn't tell my friends that I had gone all the way out to the range just to turn back.
"Okay, okay, I'll do the rocket launcher."
He smiled and then got business rolling. He clicked his teeth to another commando in the back, the one who would be assigned as my trainer. He snapped up from his card table and grabbed the man who would be our driver. They hurried over to a Jeep waiting in the lot outside and got it started.
"You go with them. They will take you."
"So we don't launch it here?"
He scoffed. "Ha, no. The rocket you fire away from here."
I looked at the Jeep with its engine running, the drivers waiting. I turned to the boss. "How do I know the rocket's not going to backfire on me?"
"My friend, it is good for me to keep you safe," he said with a wide smile. "If not, I don't get paid." He chuckled from the belly and I felt strangely comforted by his selfishness.
"Yeah, I guess you're right. So, I'll pay you after I get back safe?"
"No, my friend," he said with a grin, "you pay now."
<strong>Count to three</strong>
We slowed down and stopped at a dusty field. The driver jumped out, sauntered over to the back of the Jeep for his personal shotgun and walked over to some nearby shrubs to let off a few rounds. The commando started unloading the rocket launcher parts. He laid the tubular launcher in the dust, screwing the charge container into a tube with five retractable fins. Then he screwed the orange warhead onto the two other pieces and inserted the finished rocket into the firing tube. He motioned for me to follow him.
The rocket launcher used at Thunder Ranch is called an RPG-2 (Rocket Propelled Grenade). Distributed by the Soviet Union to its allies after World War II, it was used in China, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia until it was usurped by the superior RPG-7, now the most widely used rocket launcher in the world. With a range of 150 meters, compared to the RPG-7's 900, the RPG-2 has now been demoted to a toy for sporty tourists. But the cheap, short range weapon serves well in its amateur role; tourists get a kick out of the nearby explosion, appearing bigger and sounding louder than a long-range rocket's would.
Paul stayed put as the commando and I walked out. After several yards we stopped and the commando handed me a pair of blue earmuffs. He put on his own then hoisted the rocket launcher to his shoulder, modeling how I was supposed to hold it. "Like this. Okay?"
"Okay." I put my arms out and he handed me the rocket launcher. I put it on my shoulder, gripped the handle, and held the muzzle of the tube with my left hand near the rocket.
"No, you don't hold there. Hold here." He moved my left hand back nearer to my shoulder, away from the rocket. "And not here," he said, adjusting my thumb and trigger finger so they were in the right place. "Now look through here," he said, indicating the sight.
"Where do I aim?"
I had decided against shooting at the cow: too expensive, not to mention cruel. But that left me with nothing to target.
"You shoot the mountain," he said, pointing his finger at the crater-pocked mountain on the horizon.
He then moved behind me and put his hand on my back, bracing me. "Okay, you count to three and you shoot."
"Oh. Okay," I said, startled that this would be the extent of my training. Though he was bracing me, I knew he had removed himself from the scene. Having done his job--driving, assembling, training--he now just waited for me to finish up. I tested the resistance of the trigger with my finger, realizing all that stood between me and the final explosion was my counting.
"One..."
I thought back to the boss' confident assurances, his promises of a safe and predicatable rocket launch, and how these all came from a man with a scarred hand. But the counting had started; the launch was inevitable. I pushed the thought from my mind.
"Two..."
And I assumed everyone in town knew not to hang out around this mountain. By now, I imagined, stories would have spread about the tourists and their explosions.
"Three."
Gritting my teeth, I pulled, feeling the click of the trigger.
I was surrounded by a rush of smoke and I heard the grating hiss of the rocket.  But then the sound subsided and it got quiet. My back was tense anticipating the recoil, but there was none, since the rocket exhaust burst out the back of the open tube. Not much of a sensation at all, really. I wondered whether it had been worth the cash, whether I had added one more crater, made another little explosion on the slouching hill that I and fellow tourists had claimed as the setting of our Cambodian adventure stories. Had I even hit the mountain? It was hard to make out. I looked out at the horizon, squinting beyond the smoke, hoping that I hit something, then realizing I never really aimed for anything in the first place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not unusual to ask yourself, while entertaining the hypothetical notion that you had run a major journal of opinion during the 1980s, how you would have responded to the AIDS crisis during its frightening early days. A lot of answers are possible, from advocating blind, noble compassion to, on the other extreme, calculating the best way to protect the public as a whole with little regard for the individual. You would cross the line from utilitarianism to vaguely fascistic crudity around the time you wrote, "Everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals."

<!--more-->
A proposition: some appearances to the contrary, that line's author was not a charming man. He was not the impeccably suave personification of bonhomie he made himself out to be. Since this is the first time I've read it written down, I have to assume it's a counterintuitive proposition¬≠--that I don't want to sip martinis in heaven with William F. Buckley, Jr.
My reasoning goes something like this: most Americans didn't personally know Bill Buckley, the iconic founder of The National Review. Our experiences of the man were fundamentally different from the warm tributes we've read in the major newspapers and even in the organs of the Left. For us, his aristocratic demeanor was a patronizing posture carefully designed to justify his reactionary politics, and his actual policies were disastrous. However urbane he may have seemed to his acquaintances, to the rest of us he sounded like the hyper-privileged and over-educated son of a Texas oil baron. Which he was.
Maybe when he tilted back and ran his mouth off on Firing Line, his rhetorical gymnastics were just stretches. So were his intonations--Buckley's nanny brought him up speaking Spanish, and when he learned English he consciously selected his vaguely Brahminic accent. In the rare instances when he switched from poly- to monosyllabics, he didn't sound elegant; calling Gore Vidal queer wasn't that clever.
In print he didn't always come off much better. God and Man at Yale ended my junior year's brief reactionary moment. And Buckley's long pieces on sailing for The New Yorker and The Atlantic--here's a sample:
Demoralization was setting in. I revived the crew by serving hardtack and port. The sweet alcoholic potion revived their spirits, and the chewy hardtack gave sustenance. The sun soon crept out, giving me a sight, and on we slogged in a 40-knot wind, eleven hours close-hauled on a starboard tack, ocean water taking up one third of the cubic space of the cockpit, arriving finally in that tipsy boat at St. George's Harbor.
--weren't even all that readable.
In the obituaries, Buckley got credit--and the special halo that only the iconoclasts in American politics wear--from liberals for coming out against the war in Iraq (after it started) and the war on drugs (with a lot of qualifications). But those weren't his passions; dismantling social democracy and doing the legwork for nuclear holocaust were. He never got around to the second, but he had plenty of success with the first. Maybe a grudging sort of respect for the man's accomplishments is in order, but not for his charm.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Fedora trumps acetaminophen</strong>
I was feeling pretty viral the other day. I didn't become an Internet superstar, a blogoshpere darling, a MySpace entrepreneur. There are, after all, two kinds of viral these days: the bodily kind and the cyberspace kind. I mean a real, non-web virus--influenza--making me feel sick. Mucus, headache, fever alternating with chills, mild nausea, that sort of thing. Burdened by this infected and miserable state of willing my white blood cells to victory, I was cured--or at least most welcomingly distracted--by the viralest of viral videos: the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

<!--more-->
I struggled through my NyQuil daze, eager for a glimpse of 65-but-still-beefy Harrison Ford. There were flashing lights and everything was tinged with brown. The music swelled against a patchwork of images as the text proclaimed: "He protected the power of the divine" (falling sand and hieroglyphs), "he saved the cradle of civilization" (flocks of birds and children running), "he triumphed over the armies of evil" (Nazis burning books). The American flag fluttered before the words "The adventure continues." Then, stooping to pick up and replace his fedora, he appeared, jaw as grizzled and cut as ever. I felt my antibodies swell with pride and the pesky invaders tremble at the sound of Indy's whip. In the trailer, many things exploded, Shia LeBoeuf gaped and half-naked natives rushed down temple steps. The movie wasn't coming until May 22, but I was already saved.
It may have been the flu's fault that Indiana Jones transfixed me, but marketing flacks insist it was the juicy web platform they designed for the movie's ad campaign. Because they need to appeal to the younger action flick demographic, Paramount has to attract moviegoers with something other than nostalgia. (I did see the originals, but theoretically I'm too young to have been one of those in the late 80s who loved Indy the first time around). The trailer is pretty standard action fare, but Paramount claims that in combination with theatrical release, the online trailer--available on Yahoo movies and the official IndianaJones.com--reached 200 million people worldwide in its first week. This sounds like, and probably is, a very inflated claim--Yahoo only counted 4.1 million views of the web video on its site that first week. But for a web video, those numbers equal YouTube sensation. The small, streaming box may not be as impressive as a trailer on the silver screen, but the marketers know the youth are on the Internet, not in the theaters. It looks like Indiana Jones may be the man to convert page views to ticket sales. And to whip the flu into shape.

<strong>Speeding and loitering and forgery, oh my! </strong>
As if you weren't wasting enough time on the Internet earning imaginary rice to cure world hunger and reloading Pitchfork every 30 seconds, one of the newest opportunities for cyber-procrastination, the blog Guess My Crime!, provides similarly addictive, similarly questionable entertainment. Since January, the blogger known simply as BROCK has uploaded one goofy mug shot every day, asking readers to choose one of three minor criminal offenses (No proof of insurance? Drug paraphernalia? Public intoxication?) to pair with the face in the photograph. With a simple click-here-for-correct-answer button below the matching image, Guess My Crime! can be a simple, solitary pastime or a competitive guessing game.
It's eerily reminiscent of Guess Who?, the Milton Bradley game of yesteryear. Guess Who? teaches players easy ways to classify strangers--Does your person have a beard? Is your person wearing a hat?--while Guess My Crime! teaches players how to more accurately surmise which crimes those strangers have committed. Did the man with the Frank Zappa moustache commit assault, speeding or retail theft? Was the woman who looks a little like Aunt Linda arrested for possession of a controlled substance, driving with a suspended license or failure to comply? Looking at the mug shots on Guess My Crime!, I get the same queasy feeling I got from looking at Tom from Guess Who?, that droopy-looking fellow with the sallow cheeks and the floppy hat. Guess My Crime! asks: which crime did Tom commit? An underweight, overworked white man like Tom is probably nothing more than a case of disorderly conduct. Guess My Crime! expands on the cultural stereotypes that board game companies have been working to instill in us for years.
Though still a baby in blog years, the barely discernible nod that Guess My Crime! has received from its Internet audience is discouraging. Comments on open forum websites seem suspicious of the dubious mug shots (why are they all smiling?), the unlikely crowd (why are they all white?) and the general insipidness of the crimes (what, no rape? no murder?). Maybe BROCK and his friends are taking pictures of themselves against white walls and having a good laugh about how kleptomaniacal their creepy smiles seem. Regardless, Guess My Crime! succeeds in fostering a general suspicion of our fellow citizens and, in doing so, combines the found-object genre of blogs like PostSecret and Found Magazine with the interactive aspect of an old-timey board game.

<strong>Honest crooks</strong>
Making a dishonest living just isn't what it used to be. Crooks have got it rough like the rest of Americans, what with rising oil prices and the so-called credit crunch. On top of that, they have to pay taxes. At least the man who robbed a convenience store in Des Moines on Friday plans to file--if he can get his W-2 form back from the police. The 25-year-old suspect (the name has not been released) was just out for a standard panty-hose-mask-frighten-the-clerk-get-away-with-the-cash-and-maybe-a-Slurpee job, perhaps even on his way to see his accountant. Somehow, in all the ruckus his jacket came off, and he had to abandon it in the getaway. His W-2 form was in the jacket's pocket.
Now how is the robber supposed to file? He had accepted that his was a taxable income and he was going to do his part for society--even if it went to pay the salaries of the police that are still out looking for him. Apparently, he was trying to get back in the government's good graces by filing correctly. The IRS is way more intimidating than Iowa law enforcement, and an audit would definitely be more annoying than any questions from his probation officer. He wasn't even going to pull the job except that he needed some dough to tide him over until the refund check came. And it was only 115 bucks! Sure the 1040 Schedule SE is a pain to fill out, but he is self-employed. He wasn't going to claim as a charity write-off the (stolen) car he donated to Mother Waddles after that judge suspended his license. He wasn't going to list his dog as a dependent. He might even have included take-a-penny-leave-a-penny income. There are things even criminals accept as constant: death and taxes.

<strong>Meved-deva, whateva</strong>
In the February 26 Democratic debate in Cleveland, Hillary Clinton expounded on Vladimir Putin's imminent switch-over from the Russian presidency to the post of prime minister. "I have no doubt that... even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by Putin," she said happily. In view of her bid to extend the Clinton legacy, the ex-First Lady's thoughts must have rung a Bill.
When probed further for the name of Putin's likely successor, the presidential hopeful amplified her insincerity by making an unmannerly hash of it. "Who will it be... D'you know his name?" asked moderator Tim Russert expectantly. "Yes. Uh. Mmm...Mdvd... Meved-deva. Whatever. Yes," came Clinton's own-goal.
With Dimitry Medvedev's landslide victory in the March 2 Russian presidential election, Clinton will no doubt have figured that, despite scraping primary victories this week, she should probably gussy up and work on that doublespeak. Meanwhile, she can take some comfort in the knowledge that in response to her gaffe, the BBC's Pronunciation Unit was inspired to carry out a comprehensive research effort into the pronunciation of the name of the Russian president-elect. According to the Service's website, everyone's getting it wrong: "The surname Medvedev stems from the Russian word for 'bear' medved (with stress on the second syllable), so that it is important to retain this stress in the surname. Hence, our recommendation: muhd-VYED-uhff." At least now Clinton won't be calling him "Muddy Diva." It might hit too close to home.

		<title>MANIFEST DESTINY IN KHARTOUM: DID BUCKLEYISM BEGET OMAR AL-BASHIR? by Matt Prewitt Illustrated by Mateo Mancia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1969, a young Noam Chomsky sat down with William Buckley on the PBS show Firing Line to debate the motives behind the Vietnam War. Their conversation is riveting. Buckley is at his articulate, idiosyncratic best, arguing that American foreign interventions have historically been altruistic. But the coolly impassioned Chomsky keeps Buckley on his phlegmatic  heels as he makes his case that America always holds its own industrial interests paramount. It's like watching rhetoric lose out to logic.

<!--more-->
Today, as the chaos in Darfur erupts with new fervor, this 40-year-old argument seems oddly pertinent--yet also slightly dated. It is dated because, in light of America's misadventures in Vietnam, Iraq and Latin America, it has become difficult to believe in the altruism of foreign wars. The Buckleyan view  comes off as "Greatest Generation" naivet√©. On the other hand, Chomsky's argument--that foreign interventions are necessarily self-interested--deserves to be revisited because, five years since the conflict began in Darfur, the risk-averse inaction of world governments has reached a jaw-dropping fever pitch.
<strong>
The Buck-ley stops here</strong>
Reports from Darfur still read like an apocalyptic Jules Verne novel. Villagers are being slaughtered by men on horseback who are supported by antique Russian bombers--and the world powers are paralyzed. With this in mind, Chomsky's high-minded cynicism certainly feels problematic: the legitimacy of the kleptocratic Khartoum government is laughable and many concerned observers would welcome a heavy-handed unilateral intervention, diplomacy be damned.
However, the fact that no altruistic intervention has occurred (other than an impotent African Union force and a stalled UN deployment) lends weight to Chomsky's position. Few foreigners have economic interests in Sudan, which is why the international community cannot muster real urgency. China, the one country that does have significant Sudanese interests (it purchases 40 percent of Sudan's oil exports) has blocked economic sanctions by threatening to use its UN veto. Despite the reality that Khartoum does not wield coherent sovereignty over either Darfur or southern Sudan, China's President Hu Jintao has stated that "any solution [in Darfur] needs to respect the sovereignty of Sudan."
<strong>
Darfurian manifest destiny</strong>
Perhaps we can contextualize Sudan's situation by examining America's past, when Washington's sovereignty over its ostensible territory was dubious. In the chaos of the 19th-century American West, rule of law was restored not when a foreign power undermined the American government's ability to commit genocide, but when the economically motivated expansion project exhaustively completed its oppression of the local populations. Only then did centralized authority become possible. Where Buckley might try to obscure that narrative with a moral analysis, Chomsky would probably agree with its frank simplicity.
The Sudanese government's logic and the logic of Manifest Destiny are two peas in a pod. Rural Sudan is a frontier. The conflicts in Darfur, as well as in southern Sudan, revolve around territorial sovereignty. As the government endeavors to drive out the locals to make way for oil exploration, rebels are resisting and attempting to solidify their own local control.
The inhumanity of the Khartoum government's westward expansion should be familiar to Americans who know their history (or have read Blood Meridian). In the 1840s, the Mexican government hired a man named John Joel Glanton to lead a band of mercenaries against Apaches who were harassing settlements in the vicinity of the American border. The "Glanton Gang" included white Americans, Europeans, blacks and Native Americans. Operating in places devoid of authority, they were unremitting rapists and murderers. They went beyond their mission of neutralizing Apache warriors, massacring Native American civilians on both sides of the border. The Mexican government finally declared them outlaws when they began killing Mexicans.
The tactics of the Janjaweed (mounted, nomadic Arab militiamen) are strikingly like those of the Glanton Gang. The Sudanese army is manned largely by people from the same populations it is persecuting. The fractured rebel groups may be the lesser evil, but given what they have seen and experienced, they are not likely to be committed humanitarians.
<strong>
Slouching towards Bedlam
</strong>
Recent developments confirm that Omar al-Bashir's government is out of control. It has been widely reported that the Janjaweed  have resumed their attacks on Darfurian villages after a lull for the past two years. In a March 2 article in The New York Times, Nick Kristof argued that Sudanese forces are preparing to renew hostilities over oil wells along the border between northern and southern Sudan. (The 2005 treaty that ended years of civil war is fragile and looks likely to collapse.) Al-Bashir is no normal head-of-state. He is more like a warlord with a UN delegation.
The inaction of world powers can be explained by a number of infuriatingly sensible factors. First of all, no one stands to gain by acting. Military actions are expensive, and intervening in Sudan would be a poor investment. Perversely, this fact supports China's bankrupt justification for their support of al-Bashir. Beijing claims that abetting Sudan's economic development is the best way to promote human rights. Indeed, if the Darfurian people had links to American business, George W. Bush might have made a heroic entrance by now. Buckley's ideological heirs would doubtless be right behind him, superimposing humanitarianism onto his motives. Moreover, undermining the Sudanese forces would exacerbate an extant power vacuum in Sudan's rural areas. In other words, it would be a messy operation, and no one wants to be responsible for the cleanup. The second Iraq war has demonstrated that when you create a power vacuum, you get blamed for whatever chaos swoops in to fill it.
And chaos there would be, even if the Janjaweed went away and al-Bashir's bank account was frozen. Most observers reasonably fault the government in Khartoum for most of the problems. But rebel groups have committed their share of atrocities. Rebel-held areas are insecure and rife with violent crime. As many as two dozen rebel groups exist in Darfur, and they are frequently hostile to one another. The Janjaweed, too, are fractured. The government uses them as mercenaries, but they are essentially a disorganized class of militia, that begun to clash among themselves.
These facts frustrate the attempts of outsiders to impose clarity on the situation. Despite the obvious inhumanity of the situation, there is no obvious solution. Short of imposing martial law, it isn't clear that any type of intervention would put the country on a path toward healing. In other words, Chomsky's position--that foreign military intervention is always self-interested--prevails once again, this time for a different reason: doing right by a beleaguered foreign populous is often structurally impossible. With this in mind, none of us should be shocked by the fact that foreign incursions normally have baser motives. Indeed, the Buckleyan perspective could almost be mistaken for idealism were it not so consistently employed in defense of a corrupt status quo.
And what to make of Beijing's argument? What if economic development actually is the logical path out of Sudan's chaos? Admittedly, to deal with al-Bashir is to enrich an enormously corrupt leadership that is obstructing the country's development--so China isn't actually practicing what it preaches. But it would undeniably be harder to get away with murder in Darfur if the area was less impoverished and more tied to a central government  Isn't that what happened in the American West?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The line of people outside the Rhode Island College Recreation Center twisted through the campus like a queue at Disneyland, doubling back onto itself and shuffling along in mysteriously orchestrated serpentines. On Saturday, March 1, over 10,000 people turned out to witness Barack Obama--whom introductory speaker Patrick Lynch, the Attorney General of Rhode Island, repeatedly referred to as "the next President of the United States"--speak about his policy plans, views on the national climate and, of course, hope. Even as rumors spread that the venue was nearing its capacity, the line continued to grow.

<!--more-->
Inside the Recreation Center, a low metal fence neatly contained the sea of attendees. The rally, originally due to start at 1:00, did not commence until almost 3:00. The crowd grew subdued and restless by turns, breaking into cheers of "yes we can" at some points and chanting "it's too hot" at others. On the sound system, the same peppy songs looped over and over, distorting the passage of time. Finally, at 2:40, Lynch inched sheepishly back onstage to inform the assembled masses that Senator Obama had arrived on the scene and would be inside soon. At the moment, he was outside in the cold, taking a few minutes to address the unlucky thousands who hadn't made it into the building. It was an unequivocally classy move, and despite the heat inside and the long wait, it suddenly did not seem unreasonable to have to wait a few more minutes.
Then, Rhode Island Senator Patrick Kennedy bounded to the podium and half-shouted, half-screeched: "Do you want to listen to me?" The crowd let out a roaring "No!" and with little more than a few wildly enthusiastic words of support, Kennedy backed away from the stage with a departing cry of "That's what I thought!" And then the two-hour wait came to an end. Barack Obama floated to the podium on a wave of frantically flapping signs and whirring camera phones. We cheered like mad.
<strong>
The man of a thousand voices</strong>
I was not one of the wildly enthusiastic ones at the rally and I had few previous impressions of Barack Obama aside from those of a charming and charismatic speaker whom I really, really wanted to believe in without being sure that I should. "Change You Can Believe In," the slogan plastered on the giant banner behind the podium, didn't do much to cure me of my indecision. Some of Obama's other supporters had only slightly clearer ideas than I did regarding to what they were pledging their devotion; Harriet Holbrook, a resident of Providence, said that to her, the change Obama promised meant simply "possibility" and the idea that "so many things" that need to change might actually do so.
Others, like Ian Sauvegeau, from Riverside, Rhode Island and a student at RIC, spoke of similarly vague desires, saying that the change he envisioned was one "from a politics of fear to a politics of cooperation." Before Obama even took the stage, I could feel myself climbing cautiously onto the bandwagon, though I still had little idea of the specifics of his platform. It's an argument that's hard to refute: few people of any political persuasion would deny that change is something our country could stand a little.
When Obama did, finally, rise up in our midst, the desperate adoration and desire for reassurance was palpable. We wanted to touch him, cling to his every word, hope just because he asked us to, and all he had done so far was wave and smile.
<strong>The crowd assumes an identity</strong>
The theme of Obama's speech was that "we can't afford to wait"--he to run for president, and we, presumably, to help him win. It's a no-brainer that he needs us if he's going to be successful, but each time Obama relentlessly repeated that he could not "do it alone," the crowd went wild. With that statement came the understanding that what he wanted was not simply our votes. Rather, it was the crowd itself--suddenly, we were important. Over and over throughout the rally, Obama stated that change on a national scale could not occur from the top, but must instead take place "from the bottom up." It is a statement ingenious in its simplicity: that a man striving for the highest office in the US should tell the crowd of everymen gathered before him that it is really they, not he, who will be able to make a meaningful difference. It is also, of course, a trope as old as gratitude itself, as any Oscar winner who thanks the little people will tell you. Still, the fact remains that Obama consistently drew applause and shrieks of enthusiasm for telling people how hard they will have to work for change. I have never seen such joyous enthusiasm at the unmasked prospect of taking on serious responsibility.
Obama has a talent for getting people excited about things they already know. He spent a fair amount of the early part of his speech talking in detail about, essentially, how tough life can be: he spoke of families forced to choose between moving out of their homes and paying for their medication, of students burdened by endless college debt. These are stories that many people know intimately, and they are news to no one. Yet the crowd tended to erupt in support before Obama had even gotten to the punchline; apparently, just the sound of his voice articulating and acknowledging our everyday woes, let alone his promises of remedies, was cause for celebration.
It seems that he does indeed understand the nuances of his audience well. In the crowd, Emily Rutherford, of Jamestown, Rhode Island, lamented that she had unwillingly become part of "the system." She spoke of her desire for change for single mothers and the particulars of the work world and daycare system; later, Obama lauded his own single mother and expressed the need to support the current generation of single parents. Obama's ability to almost magically understand each citizen on a seemingly personal level draws thousands to hear him speak. For many of his supporters, there is a thrill in hearing Obama's every word and an excitement that a candidate has risen who might finally soothe the chronic pains afflicting ordinary US citizens.
<strong>Be strong and stand with me</strong>
In outlining his various policies, Obama didn't ruffle any new feathers. Although he said little about how, precisely, he planned to accomplish his extensive goals, he also said little that didn't sound like a very good idea to me. I am most likely a politically simple soul, but from tax breaks for companies that invest domestically to tuition aid for college students who do community service, I found myself heartily approving of nearly all of Obama's proposed policies. Ordinarily, I would have been nervous at this man's seamlessly deft skill at swaying people like me.
However, a peculiarity in his manner of address revealed a quality that could ultimately be more important than any policy, one that led me to consciously set aside my fears and join the circle of believers anyway. With every plan and every promise came a challenge; Obama spent as much time telling us what we would have to do as he did explaining what he would do. As the speech wore on, an undeniable sense of inclusion grew in the room, something akin to a spirit of teamwork. Like a junior varsity soccer coach who convinces even the benchwarmers that they can affect whether the team wins or loses, Obama painted himself as an extension of ourselves, an equal with common goals. Without a hint on insincerity on his calm, strong-featured face, he promised us unconditional support and constant consideration of our needs. "I will listen to you when we disagree," he said, "and we will disagree." Even in foretelling conflict, Obama instilled a sense of confidence in his and, more important, in our ability to maintain solidarity.
Even if he should turn out to be a policy lightweight, Obama retains a valuable talent for inspiring enthusiastic collaboration in the face of adversity.  This talent is certainly helpful in garnering votes, but as the rally went on and Obama's grave challenges continued to be met with unanimous approval, I began to realize that his notoriously engaging style and charisma had the potential to serve as so much more than a superficial campaign tactic.
<strong>
Hope isn't that kind of four-letter word</strong>
Obama's critics, especially those in Hillary Clinton's camp, have repeatedly accused him of being na√Øve and blind to the realities of the world; they paint him as, in his words, "a hope-mongerer." He addressed these criticisms openly and in countering them returned to a point he had made earlier. "What real change is," he said, "and don't be fooled, is saying what you mean and meaning what you say." Hope, he said, meant "believing and then working for things," and he stated that he knew "how hard it will be." By defending and defining the very word for which he is criticized, Obama did more than just respond to his rivals' attacks; he tangled up inspiration with action, demanding hard work even as he exhorted the benefits of simple belief.
Obama claimed that he refused to tell us what we want to hear and would insist on telling us what we "need to hear." He referred to the urgent need to understand the realities of issues such as climate change and the war in Iraq, and his point was well taken. However, beyond calling the nation to action on prominent issues, Obama tells us what we need to hear on a much deeper level as well. To judge from the stories of his supporters and the crowd's desperate consumption of Obama's gospel of cooperation, it seems that he is what we need to hear on an emotional and even spiritual level. If we are to rally to anything at all, we need to know that our efforts are integral to our nation's success and that we are more than just votes, more than accessories to a government calling the shots. The passions of a people would be at least as valuable an asset as the finest set of carefully constructed policies. Like the parent or teacher whom you would rather die than disappoint, Obama appears to have mastered the art of combining affectionate encouragement with admittedly high expectations.
I'm still a bit nervous. I still don't know all the ins and outs of the candidate I'm supporting, or whether his policies are superior or even significantly different from Hillary Clinton's. But I do find myself supporting him and, what's more, I'm happy about it. While I can't help being suspicious of such unbridled enthusiasm for something so difficult to pin down and am wary of joining in a potentially misled mob mentality, there is something undeniably wonderful and incredibly potent about the prospect of a leader who can get massive crowds of everyday folks engaged and united over the ideas of positive thinking and responsible action.
As Obama stepped down from the podium, Stevie Wonder's "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" blasted out of the loudspeakers. Presumably, the song was meant to tell us that Barack Obama is ours. But in a still-close Democratic race, we may well be his--and that might turn out to be more of an asset to the country than anyone could have predicted.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>LOOK MA, NO HUMANITY! : A NEW VIDEO GAME CONTROLLER LEADS THE WAY FOR KILLER ROBOTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the news broke at 5:25 PM on February 20, the Associated Press briefed the English-speaking world with the headline "Brain-Reading Headset to Sell for $299." Had AP business writer Barbara Ortutay been around for Exodus, she  probably would have reported, "Moses Brings Down Commandments Weighing a Relatively Portable 24 Pounds."

<!--more-->
The article began with a bit of catchy enticement: "Hands cramping from too many videogames? How about controlling games with your thoughts instead?" This set the tone for the rest of the article--breezy and vaguely promotional. From the glorified sales pitch it can be gleaned that the headset, available to the masses later this year, "can detect emotions such as anger, excitement and tension, as well as facial expressions and cognitive actions like pushing and pulling objects." The machine's ability to detect its environment--a human's unconscious state--and to take actions that maximize, for now, its wearer's chances of success, grants the headset the capacity of artificial intelligence by proxy.
The headset, which bears an unfortunate resemblance to the device in A Clockwork Orange, is an assemblage of metal bands, with rubber head nodes and, depending on the wearer's bone structure, two plastic cheek crushers. As the headset might determine by its 'self,' the featured model wearing the prototype seemed happy, comfortable and submissive.
Yes, now the iPod-affording consumer can play Halo while simultaneously enjoying the citrus flavor tidal wave of Mountain Dew MDX and playing the melody bar of "Heart and Soul." Hoorah! But what happens if (when) this emotion-perception-reaction loop is programmed to respond not to its wearer's but to a target's emotional state? If (when) the response in this scenario is "shoot at," the technology becomes a precarious hybrid of polygraph test and trigger finger. Granted, the biofeedback perception technology is hardly new, but this headset's integration of human emotion-detection and machine-determined response represents a remarkable innovation. Moreover, it adds a chilling new component to a worldwide discussion of artificial intelligence agents in defense capacities.
The developers, Emotiv Systems Inc., acknowledge that their techno-sexy invention might spark the imaginations of those without any interest in videogames. Emotive's mission statement is to "evolve the interaction between humans and electronic devices beyond the limitations of conscious interface." The company "has created technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and non-conscious inputs directly from your mind." Capitalizing on this Auto-Freud2000 capacity, Emotiv plans to work with IBM's Digital Convergence sector to explore "applications beyond video gaming." As major trends in AI development confirm, "applications beyond video gaming" is Digital Convergence-speak for "droid armies."
<strong>Applications beyond Zelda: Ocarina of Time</strong>
The Borg-related philosophical quandaries raised by this technology's capacity to explode the consciousness-machine dichotomy are vast, complex and nerdy. The headset speaks to the question of how increasingly sophisticated AI technology has been, is being and will one day be used to kill people. Given such a task, a glitch or system error would be unforgivable. It would be wrongful death with no possible recourse. Tragically, this scenario is not hypothetical. In October 2007, an accident at the South African National Defense Force's Lohatlha training grounds left nine soldiers dead and 15 wounded. According to Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, during a routine training session with robotic targeting machine guns (35mm Oerlikon GDF MK-5), a programming "malfunction" caused the gun to fire its rounds continuously and indiscriminately.
To collectively ponder this notion, last Wednesday Britain's Royal United Service Institute for Defense and Military Studies held a conference on "The Ethics of Autonomous Military Systems." At the conference, Britain's AI luminaries presented analytical research on plans outlined by the US and other nations to "roboticize" their military forces. One pressing topic was the Israeli military's development of an AI defense system that would "kick in" with its own intuitive capabilities when battle situations "exceed the psychological limits of human command." Commander of Israeli Defense Forces Daniel Milo told Defense News that the system would be armed with enough artificial intelligence to "take over completely from flesh-and-blood operators" during engagements.
An additional primary agenda item was the US Department of Defense's December 2007 publication of an "Unmanned Systems Roadmap" proposing to spend about $4 billion by 2010 on robotic weapons. The Roadmap would replace the 4,000 semi-autonomous drones already deployed by the US in Iraq with robots that could identify potential threats without human help--a task that would be handsomely aided by, for example, a fear-detecting retinal/pulse/sweat gland scanner. One can only pray that an anxious, sneaky alley cat doesn't meander into target range. Or a civilian with one of those permanently guilty-looking faces, like Woody Allen.
Delivering the keynote speech at the event, Noel Sharkey, Sheffield University professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, cautioned against steps toward "discriminative power." Speaking to Reuters after the conference, Dr. Sharkey commented that he was "really scared."
Professor Sharkey legitimated his fear, and quickly spread it throughout the room, with an anecdote about the development of suicide bomber robots. He cautioned, "With the prices of robot construction falling dramatically and the availability of ready-made components in the amateur market, it wouldn't require a lot of skill to make autonomous robot weapons." He continued, "Once the new weapons are out there, they will be fairly easy to copy. How long is it going to be before the terrorists get in on the act. Maybe use them in suicide missions." It's worth pointing out  again the existence of a $299 AI contraption, available at Best Buy.
<strong>When there's a will there's a way</strong>
Several hours after coming across the headset article, I stepped away from the internet and called my 17-year-old brother, Will. A scholar of Asimov and analyst of Battlestar Galactica, Will seemed an appropriate source of insight, or at least validation. One Thanksgiving, he used the phrase "eventual robotocratic takeover," and it made our grandmother "miserable."
"About that robot headset..."
"Jesus Christ let it go."
"But the implications. Wouldn't you say there are Cylon implications?"
"Battlestar Galactica is a TV show that I enjoy. I'm sorry I made you watch it over break. I'm really, really sorry."
"But shouldn't people be warned? I'm Will Smith in I, Robot. I'm the one who says 'I don't want to have to say I told you so.'"
"It won't happen for a long, long time. The headset is a cool thing that represents a piece of some much larger equation whose end product we can't fully understand. If there even is an end product. You aren't Will Smith. How much time have you spent thinking about this?"
"Will?"
"Bess?"
"Do they get to Kobol?"
"Go to sleep." He sighed. After a quick silence, a dial tone hiccupped in.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>CHECK OUT MY SWEET ARCHAEOPTERYX! : THINKING OF INKING IN A TIME OF CULTURAL POLARITY</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["The tat is of a sea urchin egg, two cell embryo, blastula, gastrula, prism stage and pluteus larval stage. Or, as my friends say, an orange developing into an alien face-grabber."

<!--more-->
This is one of a growing number of scientific tattoos featured in Carl Zimmer's Science Tattoo Emporium, a blog gallery mediated by the science author and regular contributor to The New York Times.
Many people on Zimmer's blog were inspired by dissertations and other academic obsessions: the entomologist with the bejeweled insect tapestry across her back, the biology student who inscribed a biohazard symbol onto her arm. These tattoos are the visible rendering of identity onto the skin, an act that speaks of permanence and preoccupation. They have a don't-look-back, forget-me-not quality that paradoxically brings to mind the iron-jawed religious tattoos of the young Christian right. As just one of the varied wings of the American tattooing crowd, the quirkiness of the scientifically inclined highlights anew the polarity of current political and cultural identities, providing a fresh lens through which to examine the language of non-discourse.
<strong>What have we here</strong>
There is no lack of variety in the submissions to Zimmer's blog, and they reveal a community of tattooed scientists that some will find surprisingly large. As with all tattoo designs, there are the repetitive (trilobites are so clich√©) and trite (E=mc2). But there are also the practical (the periodic table) and the symbolic (a nautilus shell, a "constant reminder that mathematics is the language of nature" to one PhD candidate at the University of Washington).
These tattoos can be breathtaking, conjuring images of imprints left on rock bodies, and the fossil record is a favorite theme. Besides the trilobite, there are a slew of all-stars from the Cambrian, Precambrian and Triassic: cephalopods like pebbles resting on skin, prehistoric crabs, dreamy siphonophores (deep-sea relatives of the Portuguese Man-o-War), a classic stegosaurus.
The explanations for the body art are often goofily impassioned. A geology student at the University of Alaska, whose birdlike dinosaurs canter across his bicep in the style of natural history plates, writes, "This is my favorite Deinonychus!" Another person's description: "Here is a picture of my serotonin tattoo. I don't know that it needs much more explanation than it's my favorite neurotransmitter."  One physics PhD with a solar system emblazoned on his belly "jokes that the tattoo is really accurate because, as is the case with his waistline, the universe is always expanding."
Such specialist insider chuckles frame the contributors and their tattoos first as cultural curiosities. Then another question arises: what is it that compels a scientist to permanently paint a neuron on his calf? What does the act of bearing a science tattoo have in common with bearing a tattoo on the opposite side of the cultural spectrum, that of the extreme religious right? At a time when people of differing ideologies too seldom cross conversationally, the deeper political symbolism of tattoos deserves critique.
<strong>
Body language</strong>
Science and art have been one since the macabre renditions of sea monsters on mariners' maps in the Age of Exploration. But the rendering of scientific subjects on skin is a new cultural mixture of art, science and rhetoric. Tattoo art, permanent and visceral, comes to represent conviction held literally against the body.
Scientific tattoos are as much an expression of philosophy and ideology as any Celtic cross or crown of thorns. One particularly abstract design on the Science Tattoo Emporium is an unwinding coil, which begins as electromagnetic radiation, spirals into a polymer chain and forms an S signifying entropy--the natural tendency toward chaos in the universe--before unraveling. The artist-scientist explains, "It exhibits my love of science, chemistry and my general beliefs on life, the universe and so on." An evolutionary biologist at Middlebury College had a similar explanation for his dark snowflake (geometrically described by the Koch fractal): "This tattoo is my attempt to show both the beauty and my love of chaos in nature."
By far the most popular subject of science tattoos is evolution. The Darwin fish, which riffs off the Jesus fish by giving it legs, is the most iconic example, but there are other, subtler symbols. A student at Hunter College, for instance, sports the ape-like skull of Paranthropus boisei, thought to be a forerunner of Homo sapiens. An anthropologist sports the famous 19th-century cartoon of Darwin's head on a chimp's body. They are all a form of visual rhetoric, billboards of a philosophy that rejects creationism and intelligent design as irrational and dangerous.
There is a telling quote on the Emporium from a science student whose tattoo is of Archaeopteryx, a fossil whose discovery provided evolutionary evidence for a link between birds and reptiles. "It comes in handy as a visual tool during debates with creationists who like to visit campus sometimes!" he boasts. Suddenly, the image of Archaeopteryx joins the ranks of condensed talking points, as much cartoon as paleontological art; it is an I-told-you-so.
There is another example of the Christian tattoo "Tell Them," sometimes scrawled across the wrist, whose purpose is to pique a viewer's curiosity about what the message means. But the intent of such a message is to open an opportunity to deliver arguments for religious conversion. Unlike the body art equivalents of coffee table books, which invite discussion, such a tattoo reduces interactive thought to the level of the campaign flyer.
Tattoos of the ideological genre thus become campaigning and argumentation tools, symbols of defiance and ideology, manifestations of us versus them. Getting a tattoo that is scientific rather than religious (or vice versa) is an act of philosophical branding. Furthermore, if tattoos are physical symbols of ideas and convictions, their permanence embodies the belief that these ideas will be everlasting. The decision to be tattooed closes the mind against philosophical upheaval; it inhibits identity shifts.
<strong>Remember the brontosaurus</strong>
Even the ages, embodied in the dusty bones of the dinosaurs, are subject to change. Paleontologists can be totally wrong in their reconstructions of extinct animals. The beloved Apatoaurus that graced the entrance hall of Manhattan's Museum of Natural History for years was actually two species that had been forced onto the same frame. It was only recently that this iconic skeleton was given another head. Imagine the loss to our knowledge of former worlds if the museum had made a permanent commitment to the Apatosaurus.
Similarly, it is the permanence of the tattoo's message that stifles intellectual exchange, by prohibiting the morphing of points of view on two fronts.
First, it commits the bearer to a set of ideas and discourages the possibility that those thoughts might change. This might be explained as the Emerson effect, according to his assertion that "a foolish consistency is the hob-goblin of little minds."
Second, it preempts the fluidity of thought by discouraging those who might disagree from starting a conversation. This is because tattoo language yields bodies that are literally readable. If books gave away their theses on the cover, we could rightly judge them thus, and never need to crack them open.
Last presidential election cycle, the cultural polarity of the US was a hot media topic. Across issues like gay rights, abortion, stem cell research and public science education, the perceived divide between rational and religious was well established. One was Christian or Darwinian. One believed in the sanctity of marriage or in the human right to love. Campaign issues were framed around extremist bases and presented in ideological packages.
There persists in 2008 a climate of define-divide-convert that will continue to be detrimental to American politics if allowed to persist. The criticism is not against personal conviction--the impetus behind the culturally oriented tattoo. But the act of tattooing, the bodily institutionalization of identity, seems to symbolize an unwillingness to be swayed, a closed-mindedness that can be advertised like a fleshy billboard. Of course, that is why people get tattoos: because their ink is indelible. All well and good, but those who believe their notions to be permanent, whether they are worn on the sleeve or under, should remember the Apatosaurus.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As red letters scribble his words across a black screen, an anxious young male voice who calls himself Josh rhetorically addresses his best friend, Zack. Although Zack was a Christian, he never told Josh about Jesus. Now, as Josh faces the flames of eternal torment after dying in a drunken car crash, he condemns Zack for his failure to spread God's word. When Josh is dragged away into the burning sulfur and brimstone, he chillingly asks: "Why haven't you ever told me about being a Christian?"

With 540,000 hits, "A Letter from Hell" is one of the most popular videos on GodTube.com, an evangelical Christian video and social networking site that founder Chris Wyatt has framed as "the Christian answer to YouTube" and "the family-friendly answer to Facebook." Founded in summer 2007, GodTube was, in its first month, the fastest growing US site on the Internet, and today boasts over two million visitors a month. The site aims to win converts and galvanize "nominal Christians" who've slacked off on church attendance through the youth-grabbing medium of the Internet. However, its casually user-friendly interface--tricked out with viral videos and user profiles--is girded by a strict emphasis on content and user control that seeks to purify its forum of sinful images or blasphemous views.
The site's creators hope to generate a complement to--and even an eventual replacement for--the local "church family" many Christians see only on Sundays. In creating an intimate, "nonthreatening" virtual community amid the Internet's spiritual wilderness, GodTube provides users with a sense of belonging.
Rather than following YouTube's expressionistic credo of "Broadcast Yourself," GodTube unites its users under the more purposeful and restrictive banner of "Broadcast Him." But, as GodTube supplements its approved content with faith-based commercialism, its attempt at shaping what users see and say raises questions of who is broadcasting whom--and to what end.
<strong>Baby Got Book</strong>
Chris Wyatt is a 39-year-old former TV producer familiar with both attracting converts and consumers. After growing up Christian in Oklahoma, he became the youngest executive producer at CBS, where he oversaw light sports fare like Slam Dunk and Jam Central. Disillusioned with the sinful lights of Hollywood, Wyatt left to work for a small Christian DVD rental company in Lynchburg, Virginia. A pastor convinced him to resist returning to his cushier Hollywood lifestyle and instead enroll in Dallas Theological Seminary. There, he recalled his experience heading up a Christian DVD rental company, where he observed churches' struggle to attract adolescents to God's word. Drawing on his CBS-honed commercial savvy, Wyatt conjured up an idea to preach the gospel to youth through a hotter medium: the Internet.
GodTube is not the first Christian site to reach out to young Internet users. In 2006, both MyChurch and ShoutLife began offering up services in which Christians can maintain personal profiles and profiles for their church, with the ability to upload blogs, post classified ads and sermons and even collect tithes. And virtual religious networking hasn't been limited to Christians: 2006 also saw the inception of MuslimSpace, and even Hare Krishnas could connect on KrishnaFriends.com.
However, in mission, content, commercialism and size, GodTube dwarfs its rivals, combining the massive user-uploaded video database of YouTube with the vast social networking of Facebook, in addition to dozens of "featured ministries" that post videos and advertise on the site. Its 290,000 users outnumber even those of the popular MyChurch, which boasts 118,226. Jason Illian, GodTube's vice president of content and programming, told the Independent that Wyatt didn't directly take inspiration from any of these similar sites; rather, GodTube's hybrid model simply evolved out of "figuring out for ourselves what is most edifying for the community."
To ensure that users are exposed to appropriately "edifying" messages, the designers of GodTube rely on extensive content control. Here, GodTube is similar to its predecessors: MuslimSpace, for example, has rules about language and sexual content, and forbids women from posting pictures of themselves without head scarves. At GodTube, however, restrictive measures are touted as one of the site's most important features. Anyone who applies to be a member must first submit to a background check, and Wyatt claims that "every single minute of every single video is reviewed before it's posted, as are the comments."
The 14 seminary students who serve as the site's moderators are responsible for upholding the prohibited content policy, which states that no material is allowed that "is contrary to the evangelization of Jesus Christ and His teachings, or constitutes blasphemy, or is otherwise offensive to our online Christian community." Thus, Wyatt can sell the site to a family and church audience as attractively "nonthreatening," as he did in an "Early Show" interview, carving out a reassuringly safe niche removed from anything viewers might find offensive on YouTube.
Illian said that approved videos should show viewers models for a righteous life. Accordingly, many videos directly offer viewers conservative Christian guidance for their personal behavior and beliefs, such as "Marriage: Learn to Fight Fair," or "The Path to Purity with Ashley Reynolds," in which a wholesome blonde Christian singer counsels teens that sex is God's "wedding gift to you." Wyatt told the Christian Science Monitor that the site hopes to win repeat viewers looking for easily digestible guidance about "heaven and hell, and drug abuse and divorce."
However, approved videos also show "what it's like to be a Christian on a daily basis"--after all, he added, Christians "buy shoes and go to concerts and go out to eat like everybody else does." In this vein, many videos embrace the popular culture that surrounds Christians and "everybody else," winning the attention of a young audience. Many of the most-watched videos are comic riffs on secular culture, such as a video parodying the Mac/PC ads with a stuffy Sunday-morning "Christian" contrasted with the hoodie-wearing, faithful "Jesus Follower." With nearly 800,000 hits, perhaps the most popular is "Baby Got Book," a Christian take on Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back" ("that book you got makes me so holy"). Biblical passages sit alongside many videos to underscore their relation to Christian edict. If lyrics like "it's worn, it's torn, and you know that girl's reborn" don't exactly get viewers speaking in tongues, "Baby Got Book" is accompanied by Hebrews 4:12.
Wyatt has compared the site to a religious "Switzerland" where people of all ideological persuasions are welcome. However, the presence of some videos that have made it past censors--such as "Mormonism exposed" or "the papacy is not biblical"--seems to belie assertions about the site's openness.
<strong>
Care for a ringtone with your apocalypse?</strong>
In addition to videos that denigrate other branches of Christianity, viewers can also watch videos whose use of fear and violence is similar to that of "A Letter from Hell," such as one in which the apocalypse comes during a preacher's sermon. While some users embrace their fire and brimstone fervor, others denounce them as contrary to biblical messages of love and tolerance. If such controversial videos are approved despite the site's avowedly restrictive measures against "offensive" or "threatening" content, what does the site's purifying mission really mean?
Illian said that he doesn't think a violence-based ideology should be the site's primary evangelistic tactic, but added that the image of "Christ getting crucified on a cross" was itself violent and that "we shouldn't shy away from that." Illian noted that for every violent video on the site, viewers "didn't see the ten or twenty ones we didn't let come through."
While users may obtain some control over each other's content by choosing what to view and flagging videos as inappropriate, GodTube meanwhile directs their attention to commercial messages over which they have less control. In addition to groups, like Christian Health and Fitness, in which users can unite over shared interests, users are also enticed to join sponsored groups such as Christian Psychiatry Live.
Unlike the media-sharing and tithe-collecting on MyChurch, which is limited to churches only and is relatively isolated from corporate advertising, any group approved by GodTube can solicit users. For example, banner ads persuade users to "submit a video and win a FREE four-year scholarship" to Liberty University, the Jerry Falwell's conservative Christian school. Illian sees this constant commercial exposure as in perfect alignment with the site's emphasis on purification of content, since the site's developers "filter what [they] bring to the community" by providing ads that are as "edifying and nurturing and meaningful" as the site's other features. In the GodTube ethos, commercialism and evangelism bond together to guide users towards a Christian lifestyle. Consumers become righteous by both worshipping and shopping.
<strong>Swing Low, Sweet Cyberspace</strong>
To further its goal of creating an online community as focused and intimate as a local church, GodTube's executives plan to overhaul the site to further encourage users to engage with each other. Soon, churches and bands will have profiles. In the next two or three months, Illian said, GodTube will move away from its YouTube-mimicking model towards a more Facebook feel, allowing churches to create profiles which allow them to share "cool tools" like sermons, blogs and even event notices.
As GodTube shifts its focus from winning young converts to expanding local faith connections, its decisions about what's desirable, what's offensive, and what's just plain profitable may get even trickier to shape towards a shared ideal of wholesomeness. Tailoring content to lure the roving attention of cyberspace masses who like a heavy dose of viral pop culture with their salvation--while also catering to tighter-knit, older and more traditional audiences from local communities--is hard enough. While seeking to "edify" and commercially sway both, GodTube's mission to satisfy a variety of groups increasingly becomes a tricky ideological balancing act of entertaining all while alienating none.
But as some churchgoers feel ever more polarized from mainstream culture, and potential converts and consumers increasingly center their identities in the Internet, the site's indubitable attractions position it to surmount its mixed bag of goals and audiences. Slickly transitioning the traditional comforts of sharing faith into a sometimes alienating culture that increasingly demands the quick, the splashy and the virtual, GodTube may be the most reassuring online home for those seeking to believe, to belong and to buy.
After all, "this," Wyatt says, "is Jesus 2.0."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PEELING THE ONION : JOHN EMIGH AND PEER GYNT by Aaron Cutler Illustration by Megan Billman</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For more than 20 years, Professor John Emigh tried to direct Peer Gynt at Brown, but the Sock & Buskin board wouldn't bite. Students and faculty, actors and designers were scared by its size. With its exotic locales, six-hour running time and ideal cast of 60, Gynt seemed made more for the mind than for the stage. But he kept pushing and, last year, after more than 50 Brown productions, Emigh finally got his wish. He made a brief speech, and the show was his, slated to run March 6-16, 2008.
But the problem remained: how do you stage a play too large to perform? And how do you do so in a small community?

<!--more-->
<strong>Man and man</strong>
Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, who would 14 years later write the naturalistic A Doll's House, penned Gynt in 1867 without any intent of its being performed. It shows, in rhyming verse, the titular hero leaving home to travel the world. He meets madmen, traders and trolls (Grieg wrote In the Hall of the Mountain King to underscore them), romances beautiful women and finally returns--perhaps--to a sweet girl back home. He's a historian in Egypt, a slave trader in China and a religious charlatan in Arabia, all in search of self-fulfillment and gold--and the two aren't always separate. "The Gyntian self is a teeming flood / Of needs, ideas and wants," he says, and acts accordingly. His self-reflective selfishness is in tune with modern culture. Peer says of himself, "How much more contemporary can you be?"
Gynt's been staged often. Emigh first saw it in 1963 as an Amherst junior visiting Smith College. He left underwhelmed by the production, but thought he had seen an extraordinary play. He says, "I remember loving the imagination and the sweep of it... There are so many plays that you walk out of feeling deeper, but not larger. This is a play that expands your sense of the world."
Emigh liked impossible theatre--not just Ibsen, but Beckett and Brecht. He began college as an English major, fell into acting and took time off to travel in Morocco and Spain, where he translated a Lorca play. While abroad, he played saxophone in a Jewish twist band to support himself and lived next to an open market in Marrakesh. Each day he crossed the square, saw trained bears and storytellers and learned that theatre was more than metered poetry. By the time he returned to Amherst and saw Gynt at Smith, he had learned how wild it could be. The square had a richness, he says, that he's been trying to capture since.
<strong>
Act without script</strong>
Emigh came to Brown in 1967, after an MFA at Tulane and an off-Broadway run of his Amherst production of Waiting for Godot. Like Peer, though, he grew restless in one place, and in 1974 he traveled again. He went to Bali, where he learned about masks from the famed I Nyoman Kakul. Kakul was the greatest masked performance artist of his generation; Emigh couldn't even afford a hotel room. Kakul took him in and gave him lessons. Emigh says, "It's a little like going to England and having someone tell you, 'I'm sorry, you have to live with Laurence Olivier for a year.'"
Kakul was that good. In contrast to most Western actors, who followed the same script each night, his performances were improvised. He created characters by examining their masks; character then dictated action, not vice versa. Years later, Emigh learned that Kakul had been praying for someone to chronicle him. Emigh did, both through scholarship--his book Masked Performance is key to Western theatrical studies--and through performance.
Emigh has performed mask shows in New England and in more distant places like Indonesia and Japan. He could have done more professionally but was happy at Brown, where he saw an eagerness in student actors he hadn't seen in professionals. With 40 years of teaching at Brown under his belt, Emigh is one of the University's longest-serving members.
He's given performances at Brown as well. In one, he waddled into Sayles Hall in bare feet, bent over and wearing an old woman's wrinkled face. He spoke quickly in a high, shrill voice as he told a fable about an island that included Roe v. Wade jokes. Afterwards, he became a mustachioed tourist and asked people how they'd liked the show.
<strong>
The new tenants</strong>
Students like Emigh, and he likes them. He treats them with the respect he learned in Morocco, where a telegraph operator once loaned him five dollars and trusted him to mail it back. But although he won't say so, he's faced a conflict: by staying at Brown, he's had to bring big dreams onto a small stage. This is evident in the shows he's directed recently--in the past five years he's mounted a Shakespeare play, a Greek tragedy and a musical. They couldn't be as strong as many professional productions--that would have taken more time and money--but Emigh has shot for greatness, and Brown theatre's been richer for it. Gynt is larger, though, than all of these shows, and staging it has required even more effort.
He held auditions in December. He'd cut Gynt down to three hours, but his adaptation still called for 85 roles. Emigh's a teacher as much as an artist, and he wanted to give his cast as much to do as possible. He asked student auditioners to play rock stars, sexy trolls and old sexy trolls, start off as babies at one end of the room and crawl towards death at the other.
He faced a challenge in casting Peer. He had two choices: He could find a virtuoso to play Peer all the way through. Or he could take a cue from a scene late in the play, in which Peer peels an onion and compares his many selves to each layer--there goes the shipwreck survivor, the gold-digger, the prophet. He says, "An awful lot of layers! More and more! / Come on! When do I reach the inner core?"
He cast eight actors and an actress to play Peer, plus five others for major roles like Peer's mother and his eternal love, Solveig. Each person was to play at least four parts, some as many as 10. Peer would be the one in each scene wearing white. The cast varies widely in age and experience--seniors Doug Benedicto, Rachel Caris and Patrick Harrison had 30 Brown shows between them; freshman Teng Yang was on his second--but Emigh tried to give everyone an equal-sized part.
<strong>
The master builder
</strong>
There are no contracts in college theatre; actors work for free and balance their lives around a show. Professionals rehearse for eight hours daily--Emigh had three and a half hours a night. He dove into rehearsals, delaying even introductions until day three. He had 14 actors, 36 scenes, 70 kinds of props and less than two months.
The first thing he had to do was make the cast feel safe. The enormous set, filled with poles, stairs and ladders, was meant by Emigh and set designer Michael McGarty to suggest a journey, even including a wooden boat hanging over the stage. To ease the cast into exploring the space, Emigh was the first to slide down the fireman's pole and climb the rigging. "He doesn't ask you to do anything that he won't do himself," actress Michelle Snyder said.
This became true in other ways. Emigh led movement and vocal warm-ups each night. When Peer was supposed to carry his mother on his back, Emigh first gave Snyder a piggyback ride. He even belly-danced with actresses while they choreographed a musical number.
He spent more time on blocking than on character work. He had to. There were intimate, two-person scenes, but also group scenes that needed constant rehearsal. In one, men toss a bride-to-be back and forth while her intended dances into a pole; in another, lunatics swarm Peer while claiming to be jungle lords and Egyptian kings. These scenes require nearly the entire cast, whose members assume one set of characters on their way to playing others. "I go offstage, shake off one skin and put on another," said Olivia Olsen.
Emigh, though, had only so much time with any one scene; he also had the dancing gnomes and the rap number, plus whatever problems arose. Two performers dropped out and needed replacements; he found a fiddler to play Grieg and Bart√≥k, but she hurt her wrist and was replaced as well. He stayed up late after rehearsals, sending the cast emails at two and three in the morning. One night, some musicians worked after rehearsal, and Emigh said that, if they wanted, he could stay until four.
Another injury occurred 10 days before opening. In the madhouse scene, inmates push guards into pits and lower trapdoors over them. Jonathan Dent accidentally hit Chris Tyler on the head with a trapdoor. Tyler left rehearsal the next night feeling dizzy, and soon learned that he had a concussion. Emigh gave him the next four days off. By the time he came back, the show was better than anyone had hoped.
<strong>
A dream play</strong>
Emigh will retire from Brown next year. Whether he directs next year depends on what the board picks. He will stay in Providence and visit campus, but he'd also like to see friends in India. "I plan to live a long life," Emigh says.
If Gynt is Emigh's last Brown show, it will be fitting. It's easy to see its carnival as a return to his Marrakesh square. One can also say that Emigh is like Peer. Both have many selves and like to travel. Both love direct experience, which theatre provides. Both also have a place they call home, and in the lovely ending that Emigh has invented, Peer learns he can go back to it. The concept of journey-and-return unites the show.
A group of faculty and students have taken a play never meant for performance and turned it into a work of breathless imagination. What it lacks in budget it makes up for in scope. A recent dress rehearsal revealed, along with Melancholy Play, the best Brown show this year. Emigh sat in Stuart Theatre, wearing a leather hat he bought in New Zealand and watching his actors pretend to be trolls. He should have taken notes, but he didn't. He was too busy smiling.
Peer Gynt plays March 6-9 and 13-16. All shows are at 8 PM but those on Sunday , which are at 2. Tickets can be purchased at the Leeds Box Office between 12 and 5 on weekdays or online at brown.edu/Facilities/Theatre/tickets.htm.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fidel Castro's resignation on February 20 came less as a shock than as one of the most calculated anticlimaxes in history. After a year and a half of prolonging an official public appearance (during which he did not attend his two nationwide birthday celebrations, all his media events were held privately and his annual speeches were canceled), the seemingly invincible dictator signed a letter, published in the Cuban national press, saying that he would no longer hold place as Commander in Chief. Surely the event was inevitable, but the public still wouldn't believe he was done until he said it.

<!--more-->
The letter was typical of Fidel: assertive, enchanting, unapologetic. Most of all, it provided a fascinating glimpse into the hiccupping dogma of a man weathered by decades of his own rhetoric. In it he heralded the achievements of the Revolution, of course mentioning only the facts that painted Cuban education and health care favorably. He made his usual jab at the US, keeping it timely by condemning the presidential candidates, without regard for the potential of a more promising era of US-Cuba relations. He asserted that he had done the best that could be done for Cuba, devoid of any concession to anything bad ever happening. And then, eventually, he got around to letting the Cuban people know that he was no longer their president, like a slow cough and a quick pivot off stage.
The least predictable element to his swan song was how he presented himself in decline. At one point, he took on an unusual air of understatement and humility: "This is not my farewell to you. My only wish is to fight as a soldier in the battle of ideas." After nearly 50 years holding the highest office in Cuba, he suddenly claimed assimilation into the ranks. Yet at the climax of the letter, he hails the power of one: "I never forget that all the world's glory fits in a kernel of corn." It's more likely that Fidel always believed himself to be that single, glorious kernel of corn for the Revolution, by no means a mere soldier in line. And to a certain extent, he's not that far off.
<strong>Myth takes</strong>
Fidel has an uncanny ability to self-mythologize, which both his adherents and his detractors can't but respect. To the outside world, Castro's decline in health has become synonymous with the decline of Cuba. This is an indication that Fidel has become synonymous with the island; he is Socialist Cuba and will forever represent Socialist Cuba. His symbol, like his image, is all-permeating.
In many ways, Fidel's iconic power is a direct product of the system he set up. The distinct boundaries between bodies of political infrastructure that we are used to in a democracy--the checks and balances of powers--by no means apply in Cuba. Democracy is supplanted by ethos, and every tier of the political hierarchy is amalgamated into one nebulous understanding of the Revolution. In Cuba, the word Revoluci√≥n is used in a purely Marxist sense, suggesting a continual process--a constantly reinvigorated reverberation as opposed to a sudden change of beat. Fidel, ever since he came in to power in 1959, has posed himself as the most central and most vibrant part of the Revolution's chord.
That charisma still pervades Cuba. One legendary tale Cubans tell to demonstrate his popularity is that of a series of emigration riots that happened late in the Revolution, in 1994. Would-be migrants on Havana's shoreline, hoping to brave the dangerous 90-mile journey to Key West, clashed violently with the police and started to arm themselves with bricks and stones. Soon after fighting erupted, Fidel was informed that the situation needed his attention and came down to the shoreline to make an appearance. Upon seeing him, the rioters, who just seconds before were ready to do away with Cuba, dropped their projectiles and began applauding vigorously for its leader. (Never mind that after Fidel left, riot police came in to beat back the crowd and haul them away.)
Fidel's myth is transcendent; he can simultaneously represent the triumphs of the Revolution and repel responsibility for its discontents. As the figurehead for Cuba's optimistic and benevolent aims, it's difficult to disagree with him in his pushes for a high-quality health care system, a 100 percent literacy rate and a home and job for every Cuban. It's the means to those ends that he doesn't make explicit, letting people know (as in his letter of resignation), careful not to expunge details, that he simply did what was necessary. What was necessary, however, became the burden of people in lower ranks; the negative effects are diffused into the central government's periphery. The bread shortage was certainly not Fidel's fault, it was the baker's. Complaints like these--all complaints--used to be lost in the hush after Fidel entered the plaza.
<strong>Buttressing decay</strong>
Can Fidel's myth persist in his legacy? While Cuba can no longer be synonymous with Fidel, it still bears the effects of his policies. His legend, which used to eclipse the myriad problems of the Revolution, might fade; the inner workings of a malfunctioning society might now be more wholly exposed. Cuba's future now rests on a conflicted economy, one that is both staunchly Socialist and divergent from the Socialist model. After undergoing a tumultuous history of recessions, where each boom in the economy meant certain decline, Fidel made large structural changes to give the economy several pick-me-ups.
Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Cuba entered a deep recession in the early '90s. In this period, later known as el periodo especial (or "the special period," a cleverly self-conscious, if not laughable, euphemism), Cuba lost the vast majority of its trade; nearly 80 percent was cut off entirely. It became Cuba's mantle to build industries around lost imports and to conserve what they could in order to sustain the economy, mostly at the cost of Cubans' daily lives. El periodo especial was an era renown for 12-hour blackouts each day, oil shortages that sent classic Studebakers to the curb and a reduction of the daily diet down to the hunger level.
For several years, Fidel urged Cuba to hold fast against the economy's rapid decay, hesitant to draw the few trump cards he held in his back pocket. Yet when conditions became severe in the mid '90s, drastic change became unavoidable. Fidel thus conceded to the capitalist model with three significant changes: he made it legal to set up small privately owned businesses, legalized the US dollar and opened the country to tourism. While the changes were successful in putting Cuba back on its feet, the last of the three proved to complicate the economy, almost to the point of no return.
<strong>A foreign affair</strong>
While the majority of Fidel's time in office was spent sealing Cuba off from foreign influence, current-day Cuba directly depends on it. The introduction of tourism caused a split in Cuba's economy, literally into half, as two currencies were developed to regulate individual gain. Appropriately, the currencies' contrasting aesthetics demarcate their use: the dull and faded moneda nacional serves an essentially Socialist purpose--the purchase of cheap food and clothing--while the purpose of the sleek and multicolored convertible is solely to contribute to the tourism industry--the purchase of luxury items, imported goods and hotel stays. When Cuba saw an influx of 1.9 million tourists in 2003, the convertible, which is just shy of an equal exchange to the US dollar, was responsible for a revenue of $2.1 billion. The one dollar bill in moneda nacional, on the other hand, is sometimes used in direct exchange for toilet paper.
Thus, for Cubans, deciding which industry to work in becomes a no-brainer. Despite the fact that the convertible is heavily taxed in private businesses, there are ways for cash flow to slip between the cracks. Take tipping, for example. A five convertible tip (albeit illegal) to a cabbie would equal 120 pesos in moneda nacional, a rate of one to 24. Not even to mention the personal gain one could acquire from a more subversive act such as embezzlement, an easy chore in the tangles of a Socialist bureaucracy.
Yet the appeal of the convertible signifies not only a lopsided economy, but also a gravitation toward the moral ills of capitalism. In Cuba's larger cities, workers with more menial jobs in production will often skip work to hustle on the streets as a jinitero (essentially a mix between a hustler and a con artist). And across the country there has been a marked increase of prostitution, despite its illegality and the Revolution's fundamental opposition to it.
Cuba's legendary Socialist infrastructure is crumbling at the hands of its split economy. Although Fidel hailed the progress of the education system in his letter of resignation, boasting that Cuba "has on average a 12th-grade education [and] almost one million university graduates," those statistics apply mostly to an older generation. The generation that grew up in the throes of el periodo especial has a higher dropout rate, either because young people want to get a jump start on the tourist industry or because the failing universal schooling system has left them disaffected. Video lessons have begun to replace live lectures, as Cuban schools suffer from a shortage of skilled teachers. Their absence can be explained by an easy question: why teach a Cuban history lesson to 7th graders for a measly moneda nacional salary when you can walk backwards through Havana and give the same lecture to sunburned Germans, generous with convertibles?
Education is not the only system suffering from the economy's sea change. Cuba's legendary health care system is also becoming lopsided. Hospitals for tourists, originally intended to prevent corruption in the socialized medical system, now attract Cuba's better doctors. With a higher salary and greater access to connections, working in a tourist hospital is clearly preferable. Simply put, Cuba's workforce is being siphoned away from Socialist infrastructure by the appeal of a new market. And it just might continue to be.
<strong>
The other Castro</strong>
After suffering severe health issues in July of 2006, Fidel delegated his duties to his brother Raul Castro in a transfer that was described as temporary. During this time of pseudo-presidency, Raul essentially held the same power that Fidel had used to shape a nation. Yet it wasn't until after a year-and-a-half sleight of hand trick--when a provisional presidency turned into an official one--that Raul was granted legitimate dictatorship. In many ways, it was a symbolic gesture crafted wisely by Fidel: when you trade one Castro for another, the myth can carry on seamlessly.
But the transmission of Fidel's legend and legacy to Raul might not be such a blessing. Esther Whitfield, assistant professor of Comparative Literature and director of Brown's upcoming Cuba program, told the Independent that Fidel has become more of a "contaminated symbol" than anything. She said, moreover, that the transition of power was almost too calculated, that it "contrasts the improvised beginnings of the Revolution."
Fidel's smoke and mirrors, though effectively operated in his prime, do not hold the same strength now that he is no longer synonymous with Cuba. His harrowing, long-winded speeches, which in their later years saw the effects of senility and diminished health, will no longer be heard. And if Cuba is to survive the vulnerabilities of a Socialist model in a world driven by capital, maybe harrowing speeches aren't what it needs. It is not the Socialist spirit that needs upholding so much as the broken economy and decaying infrastructure. If Raul sheds the weight of the old regime and takes on a more dynamic approach to a more dynamic Cuba than Fidel's, he might accrue a legendary status of his own.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beneath the harmless veneer of cute 12-year olds dressed up in the image of Harry Potter, there are communities that take the meaning of 'crazed fan' a step further. These communities form the core of online-based fanculture, a culture that is often powered by the generation of fanfiction. More and more fans from around the world are flocking to such communities to share their love with other likeminded fans. The outcome is that these communities are starting to get a little overcrowded. The power struggles that occur as a result, with their muckraking, mudslinging and online catfighting, are spectacularly bitchy.

<!--more-->
While most people probably think that fanfiction is simply an unfortunate byproduct of excessive admiration, fanfiction actually has cultural clout in ways that are not obvious at first glance. The concept of fanfiction--stories written by fans for fans--is not particularly new. In fact, fanfiction's roots extend as far back as the 1400s. According to The Literary Encyclopedia, John Lydgate's The Siege of Thebes, written in 1421, starts with a prologue that mimics the beginning of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Lydgate inserts himself into the story as a new character, a trope often used by today's fanfiction writers, aka fanficcers. Unlike Lydgate, however, today's fanficcers rarely dare to publish their works of fanfiction in print for fear of (very real) legal repercussions. To balance the opposed demands of trying to avoid lawsuits and gaining a readership, fanficcers turn to online archives for the answer.
<strong>Virtually overpopulated</strong>
Fanfiction.net is a popular online archive that houses fanfiction from countless different fandoms, the online cultures that surround a particular original work. A quick glance at the homepage of Fanfiction.net (called FF.net by its faithful) reveals only an inkling of the breadth of its repertoire. The fandoms the site covers range from the superfamous (Harry Potter) to the downright bizarre (Tetris).
According to Compete.com, a web analytics company, Fanfiction.net is ranked fourth in average time spent per user, at around seven and a half hours per month, beating both Myspace and Facebook. But seven and a half hours is only an average--some users claim to have spent that much time on FF.net in a single day alone.
Of course, FF.net is not the only fanfiction archive on the Internet. There are hundreds, probably thousands of archives in each fandom. Many fandoms also archive fanfiction on online journals like Livejournal and Journalfen. It is no surprise that with so many fragile egos at stake and the human penchant for drama, conflicts (or 'wanks' as they are called by fanficcers) are a frequent occurrence. These 'wanks' are then dissected, mocked and redistributed to an even wider audience by communities dedicated to tracking every little kerfluffle.
A wank could start like this: Fan A posts an offhand remark on her Livejournal about a particular fandom's disturbing obsession with spanking-themed stories. Fan B sees it, feels indignant, comments huffily, and links Fan A's post to other peeved fans. What results is a slew of virtual bitchiness that can escalate to the point at which Fan A might just decide to delete her journal and be done with fandom once and for all (except, a couple of days later, Fan A might un-delete her journal--creating yet another flurry of speculation and catfights). While all this is happening, Fandom_Wank, a community on Journalfen with "mock mock mockity mock mock" as its tagline, provides a running commentary on new developments.
<strong>
A Harry situation </strong>
The situation described above is an everyday sort of wank, just a part of the daily drama that takes place in online communities. But there are some wanks that reach massive proportions. One such wank exploded in the Harry Potter fandom. It revolved (and still does) around a "Big Name Fan" (or BNF, also known as a famous fan) who goes by the alias Cassandra Claire. She wrote The Draco Trilogy, a popular trilogy in which Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy develop exceptional powers and go on to experience further adventures that do not occur in the original Harry Potter series. It featured a scandalously tangled love quadrangle involving Hermione and Ginny, as well as a murky, subtext-laden relationship between Harry and Draco themselves. The trilogy also has the dubious honor of spawning the now-iconic (in some circles) image of Draco in leather pants. The Draco Trilogy gained Cassandra Claire extensive fandom fame and many admirers who jockey for position in the self-proclaimed Inner Circle--a group of the writer's closest friends and confidantes.
So far, so good. Until the plagiarism accusations began to fly. According to some accounts, Claire's trilogy was more or less a cut-and-paste pastiche that "borrowed" from a wide range of already published material, including Monty Python, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and fantasy author Pamela Dean. Following these accusations, FF.net removed The Draco Trilogy from its archive and banned the author. Not that it particularly dented her fame or standing--she just moved her story to another site and relocated her headquarters to Livejournal.
What resulted was a polarized fan community with a group that was strongly pro-Cassandra Claire, a group that thought she was a lousy plagiarist who should be run out of fandom and a group that had no idea what the hell was going on. The first two factions fought it out in numerous Livejournal and Journalfen comment wars. Take the viciousness of an everyday wank and multiply it by five. Then add generous doses of vitriol and venom all powered by an intensely personal investment in the situation. It was almost beautiful in its unadulterated cattiness.
All this began in 2001 and has been rehashed year after year, and will continue to be a point of controversy, or so it seems, until the Internet itself implodes. Such is the lasting power of Cassandra Claire's plagiarism wank.
Of course, there's more to the Cassandra Claire wank than just plagiarism accusations. In 2004, the scandal creatively called Laptopgate broke out. A burglar supposedly broke into Claire's apartment and stole her laptop, her boyfriend's laptop and her roommate's laptop. One of the Inner Circle decided to organize a fundraiser for Claire to replace the three laptops, and of course, her fans responded by readily donating whatever they could afford. In fact, one fan tells Claire and the Inner Circle, "I just donated literally the last $0.67 in my bank account." When the anti-Cassandra Claire faction found out, the indignation was palpable. In the melee that broke out, one dissenter commented to say, "My god. You people are effing nuts. What kind of pathetic wannabe BNF ass kisser donates money to a fanfic author (one who plagiarizes, no less) that they've never even met? You people need help in the most serious way possible."
<strong>
I <3 Fanfic
</strong>
Perhaps this dissenter is right. The amount of time and energy (and, occasionally, money) that fandoms devote to their creations and to the wanks that plague them is staggering. According to fandomsecrets, a Livejournal community that receives secrets that anonymous writers send in, fans have actually flunked out of college because they spent all their time reading fanfiction instead of going to class. One Inner Circle wannabe hoped that by creating multiple fake online identities to launch personal attacks on herself, she would gain Claire and The Inner Circle's sympathy. To further her own goals, she caused undetected chaos and mayhem for years, playing off existing tensions in the fandom. She was finally unmasked in 2006 by an anonymous writer. Considering the novella length of the expos√©, the author probably spent a significant amount of time and effort writing and researching the subject.
Some might say, however, that being so deeply invested in something one is passionate about cannot be too wrong. While there may be some truth to this statement, the conflicts that afflict some fandoms seem to provide evidence to the contrary.
According to the Fandom_Wank wiki, Lord of the Rings, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and My Little Pony fandoms are considered to be some of the whiniest and wankiest. As ridiculous as it may seem to associate My Little Pony and epic wank, the reality is that when fans are heavily and personally invested in fandom, conflicts of opinion often occur. With the anonymity of the Internet, these minor conflicts can escalate quickly to all out hate-wars.
In communities where the glue that holds it all together is the shared love for an original series, a surprising amount of underlying resentment exists below the surface. A frustrated Harry Potter fan rants in an extensive and passionate list: "I HATE the endless supply of short-sighted, shipper-loving, snotty elitist FUCKING IDIOTS in the Harry Potter fandom... I hate the fucking idiots who lick Cassie Claire's ass, as if stringing together a bunch of altered Buffy quotes makes you some sort of literary genius and not just one more stupid rabid fangirl. I hate the fucking idiots who swear up and down that Draco and Harry will be having sex by the end of Book 7."
With all the turbulent love and hate that exist in the shadowy underworld of online fanculture, it is surprising that the fragile surface of cute 12-year olds in Hogwarts robes remains relatively unbroken. But perhaps it is simply a question of time. After all, it is not hard to imagine these twelve-year olds taking their adoration for Harry Potter a step further by joining fandom. In becoming the next generation of fandom denizens and participating in the social intrigues motivated by complex love-hate emotions, perhaps that cute veneer of innocuous fan-support was never truly separate from the writhing undercurrents of online fanculture in the first place.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Rot Shit</strong>
Have You Scene Rot Shit? 7"
[Fashionable Idiots, 2008]

<!--more-->
Pittsburgh slob-punk outfit Rot Shit's myspace page proudly describes their first single, The Worst Kids Ever, as "ALMOST KBD OOP." Elsewhere on the Internet, singer Vinnie, responding to a charge that Rot Shit was a "joke," rebutted that he would shortly be "doing free drugs in other cities in America because of ROT SHIT." The band, in other words, exhibits tendencies both to self-mythologize and to act as 'scene' rabble-rousers. Their vibe is less style and flair than "free drugs," alcohol and--sure--music. Have You Scene's sleeve art attests to this: it features an assortment of regional Pennsylvanian beers, a bottle of MD 20/20, a weed pipe, a Boo-Ya Tribe record and unconvincing-looking cocaine cut into rails that spell out the band's name, among other accoutrements.
As one might expect, many of the songs on Have You Scene attack the pretensions of the punk rock intelligentsia. These include "Fuck Yer DJ Night," "What the Fuck Is Weird Punk?!" and "Power Pop," which contains the thought-provoking query: "You might have your fucking cocaine and all the chicks, but whatever happened to being fuckin' PUNK?" (The capital letters, and the question mark, are audible.) On the B-side, Vinnie, over a doomy anarcho-punk riff, vociferously proclaims the deaths of artists as diverse as Jay Reatard, the Black Lips and Girl Talk. "Full Retarded" and "Drive Fucked Up" balance out this vitriol by celebrating the virtues of being a moron. The latter features trippy, spacey--one might even say weird--police siren sounds. Each song ends with a spirited shout of "FUCK!"--which, at one point, is reverbed-out and played in a loop.
Have You Scene is a disgusting little concept album in which the retardo-snobbery of a select, specialized crew of producers and consumers is put to battle against actual pseudo-retardation. On one hand, Rot Shit's steez is indebted to a kind of classic early punk attitude, perhaps as exemplified by Belgian cult favorites the Kids, the cover of whose self-titled debut appears, in defaced form, as the art for The Worst Kids Ever. Despite this, though, Rot Shit's music is so strident in its stupidity that it doesn't deserve more than a paragraph of critique, and ultimately that's what makes it so successful.
<strong>Rick Ross</strong>
"The Boss" feat. T-Pain
[Def Jam, 2008]
Rick Ross might not have huge muscles, but he has a rugged beard and a round, tatted-up, strokable bod, and to the ladies, that's good enough. This is the message that the video for Ross's new single "Boss" conveys.  In its opening scene, Ross yells into a cell phone about how he wants his money while a fine chick attempts, unsuccessfully, to cajole him back into bed. Later, via a remarkable confluence of lyrical and video content, we find out that she was "in love with a G so she tatted my name," and the tat in question comes into view, gothic lettering reading "ROSS" across an exposed lower back. Later in the video, Ross raps over a background of PYTs writing in his spacious bed, a definitive demonstration of the immense sex appeal that comes with being a boss. Indeed, Ross bosses: he bugs out on Slim Charles from The Wire for being late on a payment and, in the bizarre moment that ends the video, gets dap from Fat Joe. Fat rappers, it seems, need to stick together, even if their talent levels are drastically unequal.
It bears pointing out that, even though the video for "The Boss" would, if shown at Cannes, unquestionably win the Palme d'Or, Rick Ross sucks. "Everyday I'm Hustlin'" lost its charm a while ago, and aside from the occasional guest verse, Ross has scarcely done anything worthwhile in his entire career. "Boss" contradicts this trend, and is his best song to date. "Who gives a fuck what a hater got to say," he raps, "I made a couple million dollars last year moving weight"--and he actually sounds convincing, even though he wears a diamond and gold-encrusted likeness of himself around his neck. Better still, T-Pain provides a typically solid performance on the chorus and bridge. His inspirational boast: "Shorty straight diggin' me, and I ain't even rich."
In short, "The Boss" undermines and renders irrelevant Ross's utter ridiculousness, and in that way it's somewhat unsetting. Also unclear is whether it would sound equally good playing in a car or at a party as it does in accompaniment to a bizarre exercise in rap video insanity. Either way, it's about time Ross did something to make people think twice about clowning him.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>72 HOURS IN BERLIN by Jade Starr Noik</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Graffiti-walled and glass-domed, the city of Berlin shouts its morning greeting. Barbed wire fences and orange cranes intersect beneath an overcast sky. The buildings, like multi-sized gift boxes wrapped in cellophane and tin foil, stack in clusters along the streets.

<!--more-->
Mr. Meanwhile, our tour guide--who has earned the nickname due to his questionable and prolific usage of the word--points out the "Berlin Punks." These dudes, with their neon pink mohawks and silver-buckled boots, hover like pop art against the gray city walls. For every punk, there is an entourage of pit bulls. "The government pays the punks to take care of these dogs," Mr. Meanwhile explains, as part of a progressive municipal program that grants the homeless social benefit money for looking after animals. Providing companionship, the dogs also act as barking icebreakers for meeting other punks.
We move on. A small crowd of Germans surrounds a bespectacled fellow in a felt hat. "This man, meanwhile," says our guide,  "is a local treasure." A German journalist turned 21st century bard, the man in question travels the streets reciting the daily news in poetic form.
<strong>
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome</strong>
"I assume, meanwhile, that you must be here for the Berlin Film Festival," says our tour guide, and he is correct. It is the last weekend of the 58th Berlinale and my friend Gienni has invited a group of us here to celebrate her 21st birthday. All together, we make seven. Lorenzo has just flown in from Rome. Adri√°n arrived last night from Madrid. Ariel has taken the train from Paris. Cami and Agus are at their final European backpack stop before returning to Argentina. And I am fresh off the plane from Providence, Rhode Island.
A motley grouping, we have in common just two things: our friendship with the beautiful Gienni and an invitation to spend 72 hours in Berlin. Karim Chrobog, the half-Egyptian, half-German filmmaker friend of Gienni's, will be screening his documentary War Child on Sunday.
<strong>
A tiger is a tiger, not a lamb</strong>
I find myself immersed in two cultural realms simultaneously. Strolling through Alexanderplatz, I am surrounded by German-speaking youths and neon restaurant slogans advertising currywurst sausages and a Schultheiss beer for four euros apiece. At the same time, my Spanish and Italian traveling companions roll their R's, debate over Argentina's and Madrid's different interpretations of the word apoyarse and sing drunken lyrics to "Vivo per Lei." Blue jeaned and English-speaking, I am feeling somewhat pale in comparison.
Breakfast ends at 11 AM, dinner starts at 11 PM. Lunch is skipped in favor of five o'clock coffee. For my newfound European buddies, sightseeing is secondary to the leisurely enjoyment of meals and each other's company. Yet no sight is left unseen. At Checkpoint Charlie, I hug a model-sized version of the world. In front of the Brandenburg Gate, Gienni passes a local her camera only to receive a zoomed-in image of the photographer's puzzled face. In Peter Eisenman's sobering Jewish Memorial, the Field of Stelae, I walk on unevenly sloped ground amidst variously-sized slabs of concrete. At the entrance to St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Adri√°n and Ariel are in a heated debate over the role of the Church. Cami mocks the boys, accusing them of "thinking less than pillows." Later on, as if to disprove her, they debate again about the origins of evil.
Lost in the subway, we try to make sense of the German street signs. Lorenzo passes me his Lonely Planet guide, but it is written in Italian. Gienni, not knowing any German, shouts "Commen Backen!" to a Mercedes taxi that zooms by. In need of a rest and a boost, we check out a Berlin Starbucks, where I am the unfortunate recipient of a hairy chocolate-chip cookie.
<strong>
You'll never turn the vinegar to jam</strong>
We visit the Museum Berggruen to see a collection of Picasso pieces in shades of pink and blue. One of his drawings, Portrait of Fran√ßoise, resides elegantly in the corner. A beautiful woman, big-eyed and wild-haired, rests her chin on a solitary hand. There are works by Paul Klee and Henri Matisse hanging in the cream-walled enclaves of the three-story building. With no more than 10 paintings displayed in each room, a Thomas Crown Affair would prove challenging. I take off my cumbersome winter coat, only to be asked by a gray-bearded curator to please put it back on. The top floor is said to have been the residence of Heinz Berggruen, the German-born Jewish art collector whose 1990s gallery exhibition in Berlin was a noble gesture of reconciliation.
There are base pleasures to be found in Berlin alongside the loftier ones. Underground clubs, hidden behind bunker-like steel fortifications, offer techno beats, tight-fitting oxford shirts, and flashing lights. Entering the club Felix is like walking into a marble mansion turned run-down artist's studio. Upstairs is a quiet space designated for those keener on chatting than twirling. Downstairs, dudes and dudettes showcase acrobatic dance moves. I, I can remember, standing by the wall, and the guards shout above our heads, and we kissed as though nothing could fall, and the shame was on the other side. David Bowie's 1970s "Heroes" lyrics memorialize the zeitgeist of the Cold War era. Tonight, a younger generation pays homage to the rock-star-representatives of the "original cool"--Bowie, Nina Hagen, Iggy Pop. Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever, then we can be heroes just for one day.
This weekend in particular, night-owl journalists and photographers are in pursuit of scandal and spectacle. With its maelstrom of movie hype and street-side glitterati, the annual Berlin Film Festival is making a dramatic impact on the city. The Sunday morning cover page of the Berliner Kurier displays Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman at the premiere of The Other Boleyn Girl. Newspaper reporters, festival sponsors, television cameramen and international media companies have come out in full force. In conversation with Gienni's friend Karim, I am given a glimpse into the workings of the Berlinale.
Towering alongside the Cannes, Venice and Sundance festivals, the Berlinale is known for both its edgy independents and Hollywood blockbuster hits. Entry for film screening is eerily reminiscent of the college application process: a submission fee is required along with a director bio, a synopsis and a preview. A highly trained festival staff watches the films and then selects less than 10 percent of all submissions, which amounts to about 500 films.
Acceptance into the festival program does not translate into immediate profit and fame; instead, it is an opportunity for exposure amid fierce competition and bubbling talent. Golden and silver bears, the most prestigious prizes, are granted by the International Jury to movies in the competition. Independent films are honored with the Teddy Award.
<strong>
The continent of Europe is so wide
</strong>
In the theatre lobby, I am momentarily submerged in a crowd of gray-coated, black-gloved moviegoers. Feeling sneaky alongside pillars draped in red velvet, I take advantage of my anonymity and peel off a Berlinale wall poster as a future dorm room souvenir. Before the screening, Karim walks on stage in jeans and a navy blazer and welcomes his audience. Gienni has been present throughout the creation process of War Child and is thrilled to celebrate her friend's success. In a room, free of popcorn crunchers, lights are dimmed and curtains unveiled. The harrowing documentary tells the life story of Emmanuel Jal--a Sudanese child soldier turned London rap icon.
By Sunday evening, my orange wheelie, filled with collected goodies, has stubbornly refused to shut. At once exhausted and energized, Gienni and I begin the homeward journey back across the pond. Saying goodbye, Adri√°n asks when we shall all meet again. I, South African by birth, suggest the World Cup in 2010. Berlin-Frankfurt-Washington-Providence. From the back seat of a Big Daddy's taxi, a night-lit Thayer Street comes into view. My weekend of movies, monuments and international traveling companions has come and gone, and its about time I got back to the books.
After the eternal verities comes the pasta. It's life, JADE NOIK B'10, what can you do?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of them is Dora and she is kind, the other is Eva and restless. In the dark apartment, they gather what they need. Bottles of water, scissors, a piece of twine. And sugar cubes: they each get four. Dora puts one in her mouth and lets it crumble. Eva leaves the cubes in her hands. Dora says "but then all the sugar melts in your hands" and Eva says "of course." Eva walks to the window licking her sweat and sugar palms, licking between her fingers. And Dora escapes through the windowsill.

<!--more-->
It's on the balcony where the girls sit. On wooden crates, leaning over the ledge. They watch over the last hours of light. It's warm. And they listen. The noises from the street are like a game. The car noise and children noise and the women walking home noise. The park across the street makes the children noise. A fountain is there that the children drink from. A bus lets people off there too and they take different paths toward home. Most of them walk slowly, their heels heavy on the concrete. The girls tend over all this, and sometimes they point.
They grow flowers in little cans and plastic bottles and put them anywhere there's room. In the fall, when the flower petals become hard with seeds, the girls go to the park and gather. The seeds make a chattering noise in their pockets as they walk up the stairs. Every other day they water the plants, but don't bother to learn their names.
Sometimes, Dora likes to think the balcony is hovering. That it's free from the building but still next to it. Forgetting concrete, steel. Floating in the hot rubber air. And she said once "what if the window wouldn't open again."
They spend little time in the apartment. As little time as they can. But when it rains, they sit by the window. Look out to the balcony. The raindrops gather on the leaves, gather in puddles. And it was on a rainy day, inside looking out, when Eva put her sticky fingers through Dora's hair for no real reason.
They once saw a man on a bicycle hit by a car that moved on quickly and left him in this little pile. Dora saw it happen, yelped, and pointed. Eva was busy pruning the flowers when she heard the tires screech. She looked for the noise and saw the pile. And was quiet. The bike was a ways off from the pile, one of the wheels still turning. Eva asked "you saw it happen" and Dora nodded. She said "it wasn't even that fast." They left the balcony soon after, before it was time. Eva said she had to buy food for her mom, and held up the crinkled bill for proof. Dora was then alone in the apartment, and went back to the window. She could see Eva walk across the street, little eager steps, to join the crowd around the puddle the pile had left.
They don't talk much on the balcony. Mostly they listen to the street noises. When they talk, it's of forgettable things. Of how dry the flowers get in the sun, the price of magazines they read. They talk of the boys who play ball in the corner and about things in the sky.
They know to leave the balcony when the theater sign lights up. The neon means to open the window. Dora goes first and Eva follows. While Eva gets her bag, Dora starts the water, the big copper pot. They don't touch in parting because they know tomorrow will be the same. The door clicks and Dora watches the bubbles from the bottom.
There was nothing much on the street, and it passed underneath them. There was the noise of a loud motor that made them stop speaking. An old woman walked with her back hunched, her thin hair hanging around her chest bones. They were embarrassed looking at her, so they searched for each other's eyes. Eva said "hag, witch" but Dora didn't laugh.
Eva walks around the balcony when she feels it's too small. Restless, she goes to the flowers. She sticks her finger in the cans of soil. Still damp: they don't need watering. She thinks of throwing the cans off the balcony, over the ridge to the people on the sidewalk. The soil would splatter, the petals and leaves would too, but the cans could be filled again, would have to be filled again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The lip begins to throb in the morning. The warning sensations of a cold sore are itching, burning and increased sensitivity, but the real feeling is the Greek
herpein, creeping: the lip's insidious choice to break ranks.

<!--more-->
The prickles mean the lip has begun to gain topology. Creeping is the sensation of the earth's crust folding and deforming, of a mountain about to be born. The formation of a mountain is orogenesis, from the greek oros, mountain, and genesis, birth. If one gets messy about it and takes the wrong book down from the shelf, orogenesis is the birth of the mouth, from the Latin os, oris: the mouth, opening.
A cold sore that pops up and splits open is both versions,  correct and incorrect: it is the making of a new and tiny mountain, and a new and tiny mouth. Like a mouth, it is a cleft, a pink flesh cavity with lip on either side. Like a mountain, it is an elevated landform, a protruding thing.
The creeping of herpein is the motion of a lizard, slinking and gliding. This is the same motion as a rumor spreading, the opening of one mouth after another.
Herpes simplex I [Oral] is Herpes labialis. It is important to note that labia are any lips, including but not limited to the vaginal. Labial consonants are those articulated either with both lips (bilabial articulation) or with the lower lip and the upper teeth (labiodental articulation). English [m] is a bilabial nasal sonorant, [b] and [p] are bilabial stops, [v] and [f] are labiodental fricatives. The Herpes ulcer may or may not interfere with the formation of these.
Herpes labialis is an inf(l)ection caused by the Herpes simplex virus. The virus leads to the advance of small and usually quite painful blisters on the skin of the lips, mouth, gums or surrounding areas. Mild fever may occur. Occasionally, yellow crusts, like lava, can form on the tip of the blister, sloughing later to reveal raw skin.
The virus hides in the nerve tissue of the face, but can be passed on with the help of a kiss, a razor or a towel. Antiseptic soaps can minimize spreading, as can an expensive cream made from sea anemones. Most Americans are infected with the Type 1 virus by the age of 20. Herpes infection of the eye is the leading cause of blindness in the United States, which is why it is fortunate to stay labial.
Herpes labialis is the creeping of the lips, a mouth revolt; sometimes it is a fever blister, but always it is a cold sore.
In another book on the shelf, sores are many--
Severe, fierce, hot. Strong, weighty, valid. Pain and/or suffering. Bodily affliction. Skin or flesh that appears painfully tender or raw. An ulcered place. Painful through inflammation or other morbid condition. Of blow, bite, weapon. Of storms, weather. Involving great hardship. Of trials or temptations. Mud, now (in Cheshire and Yorkshire) black mud, liquid manure, drainage. A red herring. A point of vexation. Venery, a buck in its fourth year. Falconry, a hawk in its second. A bear with a ____ head, used allusively for a type of peevishness. -Eyed; also sheath-billed pigeons, which have reddish caruncles around the eyes. A hawk of the first year that has not moulted and still has its red plumage; hence applied to plumage itself; occas. extended to other birds of prey, as the kite and eagle. Of a horse, of a reddish brown color. Of the hare: to traverse open ground.
--and cold is something:
A well-known property of the air,  of being colder than one's skin. A thing that hovers around the body and vibrates more slowly. A bath that is colder than a hot bath. A deprivation of motion, or of the dirt that fills a pit. A manner of lying flat on sandy boards, drooling. The area around a weapon. Light without heat. One stymied in a maze. Beyond the door of a room with a stove. A lunch that is not a hot lunch. Roast beef that has stiffened. The sensation of ague. The opposite of something pungent or acrid. Certain charities. The reverse of cordial. In hunting: not strong; faint; weak. In sport, unwounded. Of the person chosen to seek or guess, in children's games: distant from the object sought.
The inside of the cold sore is mysterious. Though technically a blister, it is filled neither with water nor blood. What might appear if one wedged a tiny speculum in the cleft? What happens when the sore meets its qualifier?
A bath of black mud. The unfriendly condition of inflammation. The hardship of flourescent light. A lunch of storms. Stiff, valid roast. A plumed, malarial hawk. A horse like a weapon. A hare, running through the grounds, distant from the object sought.
Perhaps inside the sore are infinitely repeated iterations of itself, progressively smaller mountains with mouths of their own.
Soon the sore will add shades of white and mauve. By noon it will bulge into the mirror. A cold sore lasts for one or two weeks. This is a life span shorter than a mountain's but no less creepy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HE&#039;S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU : KELVIN SAMPSON FORGETS THE RULES WHEN ROMANCING RECRUITS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Valentine's Day, the Associated Press reported that the NCAA had accused Indiana University basketball coach Kelvin Sampson of showing his recruits a little too much love. Sampson was prohibited from making phone calls or personal visits to recruits after a May 2006 NCAA investigation found that he made 577 illegal phone calls to recruits between 2000 and 2004 while coaching at Oklahoma. However, a recent internal review at Indiana found that Sampson and his staff made 100 unauthorized phone calls and participated in at least 10 three-way phone conversations since his probationary sentence. For violating his probation, Kelvin Sampson was encouraged to accept a $750,000 buyout and step down from his position.

<!--more-->
The NCAA defines a very strict procedure for recruiting college athletes in their bylaws. To the non-athlete, it resembles an archaic form of courtship, like The Rules for the coaching set. According to the NCAA, innocent flirtation between coach and player may begin at a young age. Division I recruiters can call high school basketball players starting on June 15 in the summer after their sophomore year. Coach and prospect must keep the conversations to just once a month until July 31 after junior year, when things start getting serious. Coach may now call as often as twice a week and can schedule an off-campus and unchaperoned rendezvous after September 9. On the opening day of the college's classes, the prospect is invited for an Official Visit, the debut of college athletic recruitment.
<strong>
Rule 5: If he does not call, he is not that interested. Period.</strong>
Steve Gruber, a Brown University basketball player, recounted some of his own recruitment experiences to the Independent. He fielded several suitors when he was a high school junior. "I could expect them to call about the same time every week, but they would text much more often," he said. Text message technology opened a fortuitous loophole in the recruiting process for coaches. The NCAA monitors phone calls only from coach to player; coaches would thus text players--"call me"--to circumvent the contact limits. Like a well-informed parent, the NCAA has now updated their rules to ban text messaging and minimize shenanigans.
The NCAA does not apply the same strict rule to its less precious children, women and Division II and III players. Not only are coaches allowed to contact these players earlier and more often, but the rules are enforced far less. Presumably, the NCAA does not bother to monitor the players who will not turn into a "chattel with sneakers and cleats," a term coined by William C. Rhoden in a February 25 New York Times editorial. According to Rhoden, in maintaining different standards for athletes in different divisions, the NCAA propagates its own worst image--an entertainment company specializing in pre-professional athletics.
<strong>
Rule 9: Buyer beware--observe his behavior so you do not end up with Mr. Wrong</strong>
Regardless of the reasons behind NCAA rules, Sampson is at fault for not learning from his mistakes, if nothing else. Although many now question why he could not manage to keep his fingers off the dial after a wrist slap from NCAA, it also seems odd that so much fuss be made over telephone calls. No one taped another team's practices or doped up his athletes; Sampson simply got a little carried away in his pursuit of new players. Yet, according to Gruber, a few extra calls could make a huge difference in nabbing coveted players. He told the Independent, "Essentially all coaches who are seriously interested called as often as possible by NCAA standards."  For a star player listening to dozens of coaches with the same spiel, differentiation is essential. "It got a bit overwhelming in high school, hearing so many people tell you very similar things about their programs; that's why it would be such an advantage to be able to call more often," said Gruber. Perhaps the exhilaration of a coach who is willing break the rules for you presents some kind of bad-boy allure, too.
If Sampson lured basketball players to Oklahoma and Indiana by his personality alone, it was only the players who stood to get hurt. He jeopardized his own career by repeatedly breaking the rules, and therefore risked losing for the students their motivation for playing there. "Whether right or wrong, a lot of student-athletes do make their decision based solely off the coaching situation, particularly if one sees a future in professional sports," said Gruber. For Division I players, following coaches after they are ousted for breaking NCAA rules is not an option. In order to transfer to another Division I school, they must sit out a year of play.
<strong>
Rule 8: Close the deal--Women do not date men for more than two years.</strong>
Luckily, the recruitment process encourages a dedication to a school's program that goes beyond the coaching staff, according to Gruber. "Developing a relationship with the coaching staff during the recruiting process is very instrumental in building the trust that lets you really become a part of a team," he says. Brown Men's Basketball underwent a coaching change this year, but he says the transition went smoothly, thanks in large part to the telephone techniques of recruiters. "We spoke on the phone and I became comfortable very quickly with him as a person and a coach," he said.
Despite the NCAA's best attempts to keep the recruitment procedure platonic, it's clear that some coaches, like Sampson, wind up infatuated. Of course, the feelings are not one-sided. The unflinching support of Sampson's team speaks of the relationships forged in the recruitment process. Many Indiana players, including team captains, abandoned practice the Friday after the NCAA released the report. Others threatened to boycott the weekend's game against Northwestern. Though they all showed up, some wore their hearts on their kicks, which bore the markered initials KS.
If making 577 illegal phone calls to high school basketball stars is wrong, then KAT STOEFFEL B'10 doesn't want to be right.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>POST-IT : NOTES INSPIRED BY THE SOUNDS OUTSIDE MY CENTRALLY LOCATED WINDOW by Michelle Snow</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[But first, a brief synopsis of my history with fluorescent cube stacks of Post-It Notes: When I was nine years old I wanted to begin trading in the doll-like dresses my mom forced me to wear for flannels and jeans. She said no, so I commandeered her drawer of office supplies and, two hours later, pasted what she now tells me were almost 100 of these all around her bathroom mirror, her closet, the second floor hallway and the stairs:

<!--more-->
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
I ACTUALLY HATE YOU
In the present, a burly male voice* screams, "Fuck you, motherfucker!" Someone replies from a different window, "Fuck me, motherfucker? Fuck YOU, motherfucker!"
*Meet Craig Chambers,
Age 20, Elite, PA
In Pennsylvania, where Craig is from, they do things a little differently. It would be incorrect to say "they" and mean all Pennsylvanians, because really this particularly different way of doing things is unique to the Chambers family. When Craig's father is angry, his first instinct is not to yell or throw things. Pushed to the outer limits of his patience, Mr. Chambers is moved, rather, to alphabetize. Craig's name and the names of his two older siblings, Amos and Brenda, are the products of this. They were not named these at first. Craig was Nick. Amos was Veronica. Brenda was Brenda before and after. Mr. and Mrs. Chambers fought something awful one April day and because Mr. Chambers was so angry and had already been through his collections of books and magazines and records twice or maybe even three times and because he worked in the government office that handles the affairs of people who change their names for reasons sometimes including the mob and sometimes including poor judgment, Mr. Chambers changed his kids' names.
Craig goes to Brown because it begins with a B and has good football and Brenda went to Amherst not because it begins with a B but because it begins with an A and she likes New England. If you are wondering why the colleges do not match the names, it is because Amos did not go to college.
There is a lot of pressure on Craig as the only boy in the family to go to college. He is very stressed most of the time. When he is angry, he does not alphabetize. Instead he hits walls with his fists and yells "fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck" really loudly.
It's not unusual to hear a fight. Put alcohol in the same room as hormonal college boys at the peak of physical strength and something's bound to happen sooner or later. I can't tell you how many times I've heard that last remark since moving in, but it's enough to render the terms of estrangement meaningless.
I can hear everything from this chair. There's a ramp outside my window, so it's a good spot for making out or crying, offering the illusion of solitude since people forget or don't notice that my window is directly behind their heads. I'll come into my room or wake up in the middle of someone else's diatribe, catching them mid-revelation.* A lot of this stuff is ridiculous. I try not to make too much noise myself. I fear I'll shatter their bubble of privacy.
*The Mid-Revelation of a Girl Who Is Most Obviously Intoxicated
"...so then he says, 'Miranda, seriously. We're in a contract. When I asked you to take the futon, I meant for you to borrow it while I was studying in Argentina. What am I going to do with a futon in Argentina? Tell me that!' I couldn't tell him that. He was right, you know? Like, sure. I wanted the futon. But I thought he was giving it to me! The only 'contract' I was in was the one where he gave me the futon and I keep it! It's a piece of shit anyway. I think his cat pissed on it or something. But still, Julie, it's the principle of the thing! So what if his mom has cancer and that's like a magic futon and can heal her or some bullshit. (Craig is so full of shit.) I really don't care. It's my futon. My. Blue. Velvet. Futon."
Note to self: Open window next time conversation takes place outside involving the following words: futon, cat piss, cancer. These should not be in the same line of dialogue. Open the window and tell them this, then close it because you are being rude.
Most times I can put myself in the mindset where their words fall right off of me. The sentences become strings of phonetic sounds and nothing makes sense. For instance, I won't know that his mother has cancer or that she still has lingering romantic feelings for her ex-boyfriend's freshman year roommate. I won't hear that he stole the stop sign from that intersection on a whim, ripping it right out of the pavement and running away. It won't mean anything to me that her only waking thoughts are of the moment two years ago when everything changed, when she realized that nothing would be the same, when she was so profoundly affected that her body didn't seem like her own anymore, when she heard... when she heard... what did she hear? I couldn't hear. I won't make sense of anything when she says, "The thing is I just need to get out of here."
"Fuck me, motherfucker? Fuck you, motherfucker!" I hear some muffled yeahs and alrights, which lead me to believe his rebuttal is a worthy dis. By now I've moved from my desk to my windowsill where I keep stained glass candleholders with no candles in them. I cross my arms and let them rest on the painted window seat, my face on my forearms, and look out at the people walking past my open window. Strangers walk by. One leaves and another one comes. Can I pick them off? What would it take for me to be alone?
Ha, alone. There is, of course, the man with the mushroom cloud of black and white hair to contend with.*
*Like this:
At first I see him because he casts a grotesque shadow the shape of impacted fungus on my floor. Almost a minute later I see a great Pug,* all dark wrinkles and snotty snorts, trot along the sidewalk. It's not obvious that these two are linked because the latter is trailing almost 100 feet behind the former, linked by the thinnest, longest leash I have ever seen. The man is wearing professorly wide-wale corduroys and a tormented expression that seems to complement his unruly bush of hair, as though the frantic orbits of thoughts--would the flying swing ride at an amusement park be a more appropriate analogy?--inside his head--of  history's wars and the forces that spawn them and the people who don't stop them, just charge charge past borders with heavy boots and muddy helmets, to plop in some stranger's plot of land--exploded 72 hours ago--never mix gin with war and questions about women, he should have known, the smart ones do, but the intellectual ones savor the danger--and here he is, walking past my house, the contents of his mind now on top of his head, sweeping through the neighborhood like some localized big dust fallout. What to protect me from the radiation?
*Possible Monologue:
Questions for Pug experts about their abilities
Thanks for taking the time to talk to me today. I realize the line behind me is really long and people's dogs are barking at the caged parakeets, so it really means a lot that you're answering my questions even though I have no actual intention of leaving your store with any purchases. You really give meaning to the blue vest you're wearing, you know that? Wow, that's an interesting name! Is it ethnic? I'm ethnic, but my name isn't. Anyway, so I have this Pug, right? And he's all ugly but cute at the same time, which is why I bought him in the first place. He was kind of like an experiment--like could this Pug's ugly beauty attract possible suitors, and would he either reflect, amplify or counterbalance my own ugly beauty/beautiful ugliness? I mean, I don't have a boyfriend right now, so the experiment is either going really well or failing miserably! Hahahahahahahahaha. Anyway, what I want to know is, what if he were to accidentally eat like a buttload of Post-It Notes? I keep a lot of them and one day I had this urge to just throw them all away, right into the trash bin, every last one of them. Who needs the clutter, am I right? Can Pugs' stomachs tolerate that much colorful paper? What about the ink--would it corrode their delicate arteries? This didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't my Pug. I guess I'm just living my life like one big "What if???," wondering out loud. Oh, look at me just rambling. This is great because you're paid to listen to me.
Why here? Why my neighborhood, why my sidewalk, why this man's pitiful wreckage, why his impossibly sad mug and his faithful Pug?
There is no nuclear plant nearby, and anyway, I could never hear the sirens above the chatter. The loudest thing on my block is the weekly street cleaner who sweeps away all of the debris that doesn't matter. The streets are never visibly cleaner and what about the mess that's aural, that's crying at 3 AM, that you can't help, that's pissed itself into a fist hitting a wall at 60 mph shouting some meaningless curse into the street night air? There are so many fleeting signs that I get to wondering if they aren't inside their rooms and I'm passing them on the outside. When did my day suddenly become an exercise in reticence and where did all these Post-Its come from? I actually hate you. Take it all away, would I be alone then? No. There is, of course, the window to contend with, the whole wall of windows, like two-way streets, letting in, looking out, the only way I know how.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first time I saw it, I had just done whippits with my exgirlfriend.
It appeared on the horizon of the Quiet Green like an
Ewok village, only without the Ewoks. That night we played our
own Endor games, making memories among the twigs of what I
later found out was Patrick Dougherty's site-specific Square Roots.
Ever since, whenever I needed a safe space to take hits on my gravity
bong, Roots was my hotbox. When I texted my girlfriend to break
up, Roots gave me a branch to lean on. As of today, Thursday March
13, Roots won't be there anymore. Over the weekend, a windstorm
knocked a tree onto Roots--and as of Tuesday, Jo Ann Conklin,
Director of the Bell Gallery and member of the Public Art Committee,
ruined the day-making Morning Mail by announcing the
removal of Roots months ahead of schedule, citing the "damaged
central portion."

<!--more-->
While the removal of Roots might appear as the proper reaction
to an unfortunate event, a keen eye will recognize the act for what it
truly is: aesthetic imperialism.
Where the conditioned Western eye will see a destroyed piece
of art, the equal-opportunity eye will see a beautiful instance of
wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi, briefly, is a tenet of Japanese aesthetics that
values transience and imperfection. Scholar and probable post-treefall
Roots admirer, Andrew Juniper writes that wabi-sabi "occupies
roughly the same position in the Japanese pantheon of aesthetic
values as do the Greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the West."
Where Conklin sees destruction, I see the profound helplessness of
man. Where Conklin sees smashed twigs, I see the natural sublime.
Where Conklin sees the fall of an elm, I see the Fall of Man.
After the profound success of the Bell Gallery's Eastern-focused exhibitions
such as Jukai and Cut, Folded, Dyed, and Glued, one might
think Conklin would have a healthy sense of wabi-sabi. But her actions
have proved this is clearly not the case. Should Western tastes prevail,
as they certainly do throughout the West, and Roots is taken down,
then Brown is allowing an artistic and political tragedy on the level of
Metallica's St. Anger. Brown's responsibility--as a premier academic institution
and as a responsible patron of the arts--is to understand the
political dimensions of its decisions. This is tantamount to rewriting
all the novels of Rudyard Kipling and using rainforest trees to publish
them.
I'm not a lone sourpuss on the fringes of campus art activism. A
Facebook group titled "Keep the Tree Sculpture" has ballooned to over
100 members since it was created Tuesday morning. In an exclusive
interview with the Indy, campus art activist Jake Schorr B'10 (and active
member of "Keep the Tree Sculpture") told the Independent he's
"angry as shit" about the removal of the sculpture, going so far to send
Conklin a harsh-worded e-mail about the vicissitudes of site-specific
curation.
The campus has spoken. It's time to throw off the last vestiges of an
oppressive aesthetic regime. The bureaucrats in University Hall need to
stop. The aesthetes in List need to keep their tastes to themselves. Ms.
Conklin, leave that tree be.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[BEFORE MY WATCH IS OVER
On Monday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk left Washington, DC the proud owner of a portion of the United States' Missile Defense System. Or, at least, the promise that Poland would be one of America's first lines of defense against the ballistics of the so-called Axis of Evil. In exchange for Poland's housing a portion of the European missile shield, President George W. Bush has assured Prime Minister Tusk that the US will help upgrade the Polish Armed Forces "before my watch is over."
Polish supporters of the plan worry that if a Democratic president comes to power in November, the deal could fall by the wayside. Barack Obama has made anti-proliferation a tenet of his campaign. Hillary Clinton is also less than keen on missile proliferation in Russia's back yard. John McCain is, on the other hand, a vocal supporter of the defense shield.

Although Russia objects to the construction of 10 missile interceptors so close to its borders and complementary plans for a radar station in the Czech Republic, President Bush claims this is a matter of safety for the Polish people. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, however, that Russia will target any such installations with its own missiles. Poles must decide if North Korea, perennially suspected of developing a nuclear warhead, is more threatening than Russia, whose declared nuclear arsenal is 8,400 weapons.
Although US-Polish negotiations have been held up lately because of Washington's unwillingness to speed up the deployment timeline, Tusk is confident that there has been a "breakthrough." He claims to have the personal assurances of both President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the deal will go forward in a matter of months. President Bush, Tusk said, "is a politician who is controversial for some but in my opinion is very trustworthy."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eco-gelical speaks out
According to a study conducted by the Catholic University in Milan, over 60 percent of faithful Catholics in Italy have stopped going to confession. But, as of this weekend, it looks like they'd better 'fess up, and fast: there are new sins to atone for. In a recent interview with L'Osservatore Romano, Archbishop Gianfranco Girotti, regent of the Apostolic Penitentiary (for the plebs: Vice Principal of the Conscience Patrol), announced that the time has come to watch out for a fresh batch of modern sins.

<!--more-->
Regrettably, the Church isn't concerned with the dubious ethics of a certain recently embarrassed American governor. Instead, the Vatican is going green. Well, sort of. Drawing attention to the global warming crisis, Girotti praised the search for renewable resources and called upon the faithful to renounce pollution and excess energy expenditure. But he drew the line at other scientific probes. The Vatican has slammed all genetic modification, citing the field of bioethics as the single greatest landmine for new modern sin. Stem cell research and its sinister siblings--littering, drug trafficking and perpetrating economic injustice--also made the cut.
As one might expect, the revamped list of sins has made quite a splash in the secularized news media. But not everyone, it seems, is quite so amused as they are; responses to the L'Osservatore interview were mixed at best. One outraged post on Reuters' website railed against Girotti's willingness to give credence to global warming, calling it a "hoax" and reasoning that "tampering with nature or considering CO2, a natural output of breathing, as the problem is an idiotic action at best. God is still in control of the universe and the nature he created." Newly homeless polar bears: keep the faith.
But Girotti is far from being the only recipient of negative backlash--the media's in the doghouse as well. Phil Lawler, of the online daily Catholic World News, is sick and tired of the mainstream press's satirical coverage of Girotti's speech. "Can we have a reality check, please?" he implored on Monday. He chastised papers such as Britain's Daily Telegraph for their mad rush to update the seven deadlies, saying, "When a second-tier Vatican official gives a newspaper interview, he is not proclaiming new Church doctrines... What is sinful today will be sinful tomorrow, and a deadly sin will remain deadly, whether or not Telegraph editors recognize the moral danger." So, evidently, we're not off the hook just yet. But, if you can't make it to confession, don't sweat it and self-flagellate: recycle.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been a strange week for the ladies, at least if a glance at newspaper or internet headlines is any indication.

First, there are the women currently shaping the politics of the future. I'm referring, of course, to the lovely ladies of the Emperor's Club VIP, a prostitution ring that has recently come under federal investigation. On Monday, Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York was indicted for trafficking one of the Emperor's finest across state lines for the purposes of prostitution. Four other defendants were charged last Friday with the same crime. Spitzer, who was known on the federal wiretaps as Client 9, resigned on Wednesday after some deliberation.

<!--more-->
As for another female heavily involved in politics, Hillary Clinton experienced two setbacks this week. First, the eight-year-old girl featured prominently in Clinton's "Who will answer the phone" scare-ad surfaced after seeing herself on television--and she's a fervent Obama supporter. The now 17-year-old Casey Knowles campaigned for Barack Obama in Washington and worked as a Democratic precinct captain on primary day. She has contacted the Obama campaign and might "make a counter ad, me and Obama, against Hillary."
Monday, Hillary also received a rebuttal from Obama, her annoyingly persistent rival. Both Clintons have recently raised the prospect of Obama joining her ticket as the vice presidential candidate--an idea that Obama firmly rejected. Said Obama, "I don't know how somebody who's in second place can offer the vice presidency to someone who's in first place." Ouch.

While other women are not running for president, they have problems of their own to deal with. For example, Ivanka Trump, Donald's daughter, had to deal with a minor scandal this week. A fraudulent report stated that Trump sends an assistant over to visit her wax likeness at Madame Tussaud's each week--and paint its fingernails a different color. When Trump heard the story, she was outraged, and not just because the story made her seem frivolous or because she doesn't actually have a wax figure. Instead, Trump lamented that no one called her or her rep for comment, an impressive display of journalistic ethics.

Speaking of ethics, while Margaret Seltzer didn't grow up gangster in South LA, she did make a fair attempt at getting into character to write her faux-memoir Love and Consequences. For four years, Seltzer maintained an AOL journal under the name berious b, a nod to the Blood custom of using B instead of C in order to avoid evoking the Crips. On her site, Seltzer cultivated the mannerisms that made her book so believable; Los Angeles Times book reviewer Susan Salter Reynolds commended Seltzer's "loyalty to the language... of her gang." In fact, it was on her AOL profile that Seltzer achieved her only true gang affiliations. OG Madd Ronald, aka Ronald Chatman, an imprisoned gangster name-checked Seltzer on his own website, calling her "a product of the hood."

In other news of the hopelessly trashy, Flavor of Love 2 and Flavor of Love Girls: Charm School contestant Saaphyri Windsor has found a respectable day job as a cosmetics designer. Her unisex "lip chap," rumored at Radar Magazine to be the "first multiuse personal lubricant to hit the market," was inspired by a catfight on the show. Meanwhile, the advertisement for the lip chap appears to have been inspired by bad porn: Windsor does a bit of writhing, a bit of chest-thrusting and somehow ends up with her finger in her mouth. Lip chap, she whispers. No, that's all right, thanks.

In a salute to the right of American college students to call their female classmates sluts, Yale University is embroiled in a debate over whether JuicyCampus.com (an "Always Anonymous, Always Juicy" gossip website) will be banned from the campus. Blocking the site might violate Yale's official policy of protecting free speech. Also, Yale President Richard Levin prefers to encourage a spirit of debate rather than insulate students from the malice of their peers: "I tend to think offensive speech is better countered with more speech, with counterargument, rather than by barring access." In response, students affiliated with the campus Women's Center allegedly spammed the site with weather reports, the text of the Constitution and the full canon of feminist literature--and were promptly rebuked by JuicyCampus.com's lawyer.

Finally, refreshingly hilarious American Apparel model Claire Salinda fired back at critics who deride CEO Dov Charney for being a creep: "You probably assume that I am a dumb ho who is too strung out on coke and low self-esteem to note the difference between a compliment and harassment. Sorry to disappoint. My upbringing was incredibly boring, complete with a cute dog and an involved father." Salinda says Charney is sexual, yes, but not overbearing; after seeing her nipples in an upcoming ad, she "freaked out." Charney replaced the photo, no questions asked. He is also professional: "Within an hour of meeting Dov... he, in the politest way possible, is telling me I have perfect boobs." Even if AA's campaigns are risqu√©, Salinda loves posing for Charney because he "likes his models happy and squishy." Can't argue with that.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HOW LOW IS THE EXCHANGE RATE?: PUTIN, MEDVEDEV AND THE FUTURE OF RUSSIA by Aaron Culter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[March 2 was a big day in Russia. Forty-two-year-old Dmitry Medvedev won the presidential election, with acting duties to be assumed May 7. Medvedev won with over 70 percent of the popular vote and with the blessing of President Vladimir Putin, who will serve as prime minister once Medvedev assumes office. The transition was not just bloodless--it was buddy-buddy.

<!--more-->
After the results were announced, Medvedev and Putin said that they looked forward to running the country together. Will Russia get new leadership, or Putin reheated?
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in Leningrad in 1952, the son of a factory worker and a naval officer; one of his grandfathers was Stalin's personal chef. He went to law school, then through KGB training, and was stationed in Dresden from 1985 until the Communist regime there fell in 1990. The next year the Soviet Union collapsed, and a plethora of political parties formed in Russia to find direction; Boris Yeltsin, chairman during the Soviet era, became the country's first president. He banned Communism and promised to put his head on the rails if prices rose.
Yeltsin, though, broke his promise. People stayed poor; in fact, they grew even poorer than they had been under Communism. Inflation rose drastically. Russia's losses under Yeltsin tripled the US's losses during the Great Depression. "It was a disaster... People lost everything," Dr. Sergei Krushchev, son of former Soviet premier Nikita Krushchev and Senior Fellow at Brown's Watson Institute for International Studies, told the Independent.
Corruption among government officials exacerbated the situation. Organized crime put pressure on officials. "You have organized Mafia and you have disorganized bureaucrats who can be bribed for a dollar," Krushchev said. Yeltsin himself was not accused of taking bribes. Instead, he became a model of ineffectiveness; he was known not for policies, but for alcoholism.
Putin rose in Yeltsin's shadow. He moved through various governmental positions, including, in July 1998, the head of the FSB, the post-KGB intelligence agency. That July, the government owed workers $12.5 billion in wages, monthly interest payments on Russia's debt were 40 percent higher than its monthly tax collections and Yeltsin was returning from a vacation. In August, Russia's stock, bond and currency markets crashed.
The following year, Putin became Russia's fifth prime minister, the equivalent to a vice president, in 17 months. The economy improved, in no small part due to rising international oil prices. Krushchev says that Yeltsin "started to make decisions in a condition where he was not fully drunk," but  was still overwhelmed. He was in poor health and beleaguered by criminal associates. A CNN estimate put his approval rating at two percent. He resigned on December 31, fewer than six months before scheduled elections, leaving the country in Putin's hands. Putin ran Russia as an interim president until March, when the public elected him.
SuperPutin
Putin has done much to improve Russia, especially economically. By opening up to foreign trade, particularly with barrels of oil at $90 each, he's raised the Russian stock market from $60 billion in value to over $1 trillion. Over the past four years, workers' salaries have more than doubled on average. Moscow has gone from a poor, desperate city to one of the world's most expensive--a clean, friendly place that Krushchev called "something between Paris and Lisbon." Crime, too, has gone down significantly. Putin's approval rating in June 2007 was 81 percent, the highest of any world leader. Krushchev said that Russians were generally unused to prosperity, having gone from imperial oppression to Communist oppression to Yeltsin's incompetence, and compared Putin to American Presidents like FDR and Reagan, who led the US not just from bad to better but from bad to good.
Putin's also increased Russia's world standing from a PR perspective--for example, he was one of the first world leaders to issue a statement supporting the US after 9/11. Jacques Chirac awarded him the L√©gion d'honneur. Last year Time named him its Person of the Year.
Yet Putin's reign has had negative aspects. The American government condemned Russia for invading neighboring Chechnya in 1999 and torturing political opponents, and the Russian military has bullied voters in subsequent elections, both in Chechnya and at home. Furthermore, though his approval rating may in part be attributed to Russia's prosperity, Putin also achieved it by silencing dissenters. He enacted laws that made it more difficult for members of opposing parties to run against candidates from his. While he did much to create a free press in a country where none existed, he also restricted the press's rights and let its members work in danger. The Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations reports that over 300 journalists have been criminally prosecuted during Putin's time in office, and 17 murdered.
Corruption, while not as blatant as it was under Yeltsin, is still present. Despite claims to disavow his old KGB ties, Putin's government has let old KGB members form Russia's strongest Mafia group. "His legacy will be bad," Brown Professor of Slavic Languages Vladimir Golstein told the Independent, citing the way in which the group suppresses minor gangs. "Common people might be happy with control over lawlessness, but they do not have any additional income from these changes in power." Hillary Clinton once said that, as a former KGB man, Putin had no soul, to which he responded that he at least had a head.
Officials collect money behind closed doors. The Guardian estimates that Putin himself has over $40 billion in secret funds which, if true, would make him the richest man in Europe. When asked about the money at a press conference this past February, Putin replied, "This is true. I am the richest person not only in Europe, but in the world. I collect emotions."
Medvedev is not a KGB man, nor a politburo; in fact, prior to his presidential victory, he had never held an elected office. Like Putin to Yeltsin, Medvedev was appointed Putin's prime minister (albeit first deputy PM) prior to his presidential run; before that, he served various other roles in Putin's cabinet; before that, he was a lawyer with a passion for Deep Purple. While PM, he also held the post of chairman for Gazprom, the largest oil company in Russia and the third-largest corporation in the world, one in which the Russian government has a 51 percent stake. Shortly after Putin declared Medvedev his desired successor, Medvedev said that, if elected, Putin would be his PM. Medvedev's campaign was relatively toothless--he declined to debate the other three candidates and stuck to inspirational messages rather than discussing policies.
"This man was selected. The election was simply a post facto after the selection," Adjunct Professor of International Studies and Watson Institute member Linda Miller told the Independent. She also said that the most significant aspect of the election was "that there wasn't any possibility that this would be opposed."
Putin has served two four-year terms in office. The Russian Constitution prevents the President from running for a third consecutive term. However, there is no law which says that he or she cannot run again later. Some experts say that Putin will rule the country from his prime minister position until he is eligible to run for president again. At 55, he has time left.
At one point during his presidency, Putin changed the law to make governors appointed rather than elected, ostensibly to keep the Mafia from bullying voters. He spoke a few times of amending the Constitution to lengthen his presidential term, but ultimately chose not to. Miller sees Putin as wanting to exert power without leaving a paper trail; Krushchev views him as committed to a Russian democracy and compares his choice to George Washington's choice to be president rather than king.
Miller said that the prime minister's role is ambiguous and that Russian politicians are "making it up as they go along." Under the Constitution, the president is responsible for military, foreign and security affairs. The prime minister, by contrast, handles domestic policy. Russia has elected two presidents since Yeltsin--both have been former prime ministers, both have been handpicked by the former president and both have won in landslides. Krushchev said, "Russia is not a democracy. This is a transition to democracy. So you have to change the mentality of the people to respecting the law."
Still, Medvedev may differ from Putin in key aspects. In a speech broadcast on state television, he said, "Freedom is better than lack of freedom--this should be at the core of our politics. I mean freedom in all its manifestations--personal freedom, economic freedom and, finally, freedom of expression."
No one knows, though, how these freedoms will express themselves, nor how the new president will differ from the old one. Campaign posters featured the two men standing next to each other, accompanied by the slogan "Together we will win." Yet when asked who would make foreign policy decisions, both men said that the new president would. It is uncertain what Medvedev's presidential policies will be; it is also uncertain if he even has any at all.
Golstein said, "Medvedev is a big unknown. And that's the general feeling."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THIS JUST IN: BUSH UNPOPULAR</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two towns in southeast Vermont's Windham County, Brattleboro and its tiny neighbor Marlboro, voted last week to arrest President Bush and Vice President Cheney for "crimes against our Constitution." Or, at least, they passed nonbinding resolutions to "instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments." Thanks to Kurt Daims and his Brattleboro Indictment Initiative, whose petition appeared on the back of primary ballots--passing 2,012 to 1,795 in Brattleboro, while a Marlboro town meeting approved it 43 to 25--Bush and Cheney can no longer set foot in either town, in theory, without the local cops enforcing the symbolic resolution.

<!--more-->
But it's a good bet the commander-inchief won't be Brattleboro-bound anytime soon, looming indictments or not. In his seven-plus years leading the free world, Bush has made it out to Hawaii, Alaska, North Dakota and 46 other US states--but never Vermont.
Perhaps not coincidentally, the Green Mountain State has long enjoyed a progressive, iconoclastic identity; its accomplishments include electing the first and only self-described socialist to the US Senate (current junior Senator Bernie Sanders) and approving civil unions for same-sex couples in all three branches of state government.
But Vermont residents who want Bush out of office and under arrest do have company beyond the roughly 80-by-160 mile state border. Ever since Bush (allegedly, more or less) manipulated CIA intelligence justifying the invasion of Iraq, implemented warrantless wiretapping, commuted Scooter Libby's prison sentence for political reasons and authorized torture of detainees in violation of the Geneva Conventions, among other misconducts, many Americans have toyed with the idea of impeachment.
<strong>
Getting off the ground</strong>
In late 2005, Michigan Representative John Conyers submitted a resolution in the House to form a committee to investigate "grounds for possible impeachment," which 38 of his fellow Democratic representatives cosponsored. One year later, Georgia Representative Cynthia McKinney introduced articles of impeachment against Bush; both bills expired at the end of that Republican-controlled Congressional session. The movement lost steam after then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pledged not to pursue impeachment. Last year, Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio introduced two identical bills six months apart to impeach Cheney, both of which have floated around as news and floundered as legislation.
Most Americans, meanwhile, doubt the wisdom of impeachment--those who judge the administration guilty included. According to an American Research Group poll conducted in November, 34 percent of Americans believe that President Bush should be impeached, while another 21 percent insist his abuses of power "rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the Constitution, but he should not be impeached." For Vice President Cheney, those numbers came in at 43 percent and 9 percent, respectively, suggesting that most would rather endure the waning months of Bush's second term than trigger a chaotic impeachment in the meantime, deserved or not.
With the futility of the impeachment movement mounting, those demanding justice are looking beyond the removal of Bush and Cheney from office.
A history of unjustified violence
It's been a busy March already for Tony Blair, too, who himself was the subject of impeachment talks before he left office last year. According to a BBC report, the British group Legal Action Against War recently opened a case at the International Criminal Court at the Hague charging the former UK prime minister with war crimes, calling the invasion of Iraq illegal. Days later, Yale University appointed Blair their Howland Distinguished Fellow for the upcoming academic year; clearly, on a broader scale, few see such claims of war crimes as threatening or notable.
Daims, the 54-year-old behind the Brattleboro Indictment Initiative (who did not return a phone call to his home from the Independent), hasn't done much to expand the cause. He appears in a low-budget video on behalf of the Initiative, sporting a bushy gray beard and cowboy hat, bundled up in a coat and scarf for the indoor shoot. Daims details the cost of the Iraq War in terms of lives and money, imitating the MasterCard "priceless" ad campaign. He then asks viewers to "help us secure a moral future for our children and our country," retrieving a child from out of the frame to kiss her.
With just this austere video, mired in a double-digit view count, Daims doesn't appear to be aiming for much of an audience outside Windham County. His grassroots activism seems destined to stay small, especially considering the US's long-standing tradition of failing to criminalize wars waged on fictional bases. Reversing that trend will take more than symbolic votes from a little corner of the nation that its own president has already tuned out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People of interest flyers are not rare on College Hill. A laptop goes missing, security video camera footage is scanned, and within hours a grainy picture paired with a stern warning from Public Safety pops up on doors all over campus. Yet on February 26, a 38-year-old RISD teaching assistant went missing two days after being accused of unwanted sexual contact by a female student in a RISD studio space--and there was not a flyer to be found. All students were offered was a cryptic safety alert advising that students report any suspicious activity to Public Safety. "Travel in pairs... stay in familiar well-lit areas," it suggested.

<!--more-->
Sean Gallagher, an MFA candidate in ceramics, turned himself in to RISD Public Safety at 8:00 PM on February 28 and was subsequently arrested and charged with first and second degree sexual assault by the Providence Police.
On February 29, five days after the alleged assault and three days after being alerted of the incident, RISD Public Safety released an update to the first safety alert, assuring the community that "the alleged perpetrator turned himself in to RISD's Department of Public Safety (DPS)... [He] has been prohibited from entering campus and his ID card will not allow entry to RISD's secured facilities."
According to one student in Gallagher's department, RISD may not be the first campus that Gallagher has been banned from.
"Our department was aware that he had a criminal record and that he was forbidden to set foot on his undergraduate campus again," said the student, who attended a counseling session for students in Gallagher's department, which, he reports "devolved into a three-hour argument."
RISD Public Safety directed the Independent's inquiries to RISD Senior Press Officer Jaime Marland, who said that under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), RISD is "prohibited from disclosing information about students without their consent." Gallagher is not listed as a moderate- or high-risk sex offender in Rhode Island's registry.
Some RISD students take issue with the time lapse between when DPS became aware of the incident and when the community was informed of its occurrence.
"Gallagher was more or less on the run from the authorities for three days after his alleged crime and nobody had any idea that he was being sought out," said a student.
There are laws requiring colleges that take part in federal financial aid programs to publish crime statistics. Under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or Clery Act, universities must maintain statistics from the past three years and publish them annually--including both on- and off-campus crimes. Colleges also must maintain a crime log of the past 60 days and issue "timely warnings" to the community in the event of crimes that threaten the safety of students. The interpretation of "timely" is left to the individual department, with the understanding that its policy will be published with the annual crime report. However, the RISD Campus Security Report for 2007 does not specify the DPS policy on when to issue safety alerts following a crime.
Brown students, too, have struggled with their Public Safety Department's crime reporting. On November 1, 2006, a Brown Daily Herald editorial chastised Brown DPS for waiting 23 hours before releasing a crime alert when a student was robbed at gunpoint on Williams Street. In the same year's crime report, Brown DPS reported zero sexual offenses on campus for 2005. After consulting representatives from the Sarah Doyle Women's Center, the Herald deemed the statistic misleading in an article published October 26, 2006. DPS then revised their report, revealing that four on-campus sexual assaults occurred in 2005. They called the mistake an "administrative error."
According to the 2007 Clery reports, there was only one sexual offense at RISD reported between 2004 and 2006, while Brown University reported 11 sexual offenses over the same period. However, according to a 2005 report by the National Institute for Justice, "less than five percent of attempted and completed rapes of college students are brought to the attention of campus authorities and/ or law enforcement." If the NIJ's findings hold true, there are far more student victims of sexual assault than the number currently reported by Brown and RISD. The inaccuracies in the reports of college public safety departments are misleading--and may encourage a false sense of security among students, claims the NIJ.
The 2005 report also states that the attacker and victim know each other in between 80 and 90 percent of incidents. RISD DPS stated that the attacker was known to the victim in its crime alert of the incident but, under FERPA, could not identify the student. They failed even to mention that the attacker was a RISD student, perhaps out of fear of legal consequences of identifying him to any degree. By urging students to be careful walking around campus and be aware of suspicious looking persons following the sexual assault, many feel, RISD DPS misrepresented the possible danger to students, implying that it is strangers from the streets of Providence that they need fear the most, when in fact they are far more likely to be attacked by an acquaintance.
Some measures taken by RISD DPS to amplify security, such as changing doors on campus to card-access only, perpetuate the stranger-rape myth. When perpetrators are part of the student body, such measures will be ineffectual. According to the Providence Police Report, the assault took place in Gallagher's private studio, where the victim had come by invitation. And piggy-backing, or entering a door directly behind someone who has unlocked it with an ID card, is a common occurrence at RISD and blamed for most incidents of larceny.
While Brown and RISD DPS are responsible for the safety of their students, the complex, interpersonal factors which lead to sexual crimes may often be beyond their jurisdiction. However, under federal law, the departments are required to make students aware of the dangers of their campus, including those incidents outside their control. In order to accurately report on campus safety, DPS must make it easier for victims of sexual assault to step forward. Currently, Brown offers a 24-hour hotline, which puts students through to the on-call doctor at Psychological Services. During business hours, the Advocates program offers victims consultation with a Brown staff member trained to help students address incidents of sexual assault or sexual harassment. RISD has no school-specific sexual assault crisis resources listed on the Public Safety website.
The NIJ report states that knowledge of the reporting process and school policies regarding sexual crimes will make it easier for students to report incidents to authorities. "The probability of reporting is also linked to concerns about confidentiality," it says. It finds that confidentiality is essential to assuaging a victim's fears of embarrassment, as well as the possible stigma of victimization. The NIJ further suggests that anonymous reporting, in which the incident may be statistically counted while allowing the victim to choose not to file an official report, encourages victims to come forward.
The failure of DPS to fully inform students about the recent sexual assault on College Hill has caused doubts among RISD students as to the department's ability to protect them. Some RISD ceramics students believe that by admitting and hiring Gallagher, RISD failed to provide them with a safe working environment. "Creating a transparent environment where people can be notified of what happened," said one, "is, in my opinion, the only way to keep people safe."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>IN BLIND PURSUIT OF THE INVISIBLE: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAR ON TERROR? by Rohan Maddamsetti</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nine days after the fall of the World Trade Center, President Bush declared war on global terrorism. It has been more than seven years since, and as the nation's attention focuses on the 2008 presidential campaign and slogans of "hope" and "change," few ideas have been driven further from our contemporary political consciousness than the War on Terror.

<!--more-->
Why is this? Bush swore never to stop "until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." After five years in Iraq, the front-running presidential candidates all say the invasion took the nation's resources away from fighting al-Qaeda--but none of them address the issue of fighting al-Qaeda itself.
The main reason is the obvious one: terrorism really doesn't matter to America anymore. When the administration conflated "terrorism" with "Islamo-fascism" and with "al-Qaeda," it created a diffuse family of synonyms for "enemy of the state." With the passage of the Patriot Act, the beginning of illegal wiretaps on American citizens and the opening of Guantanamo Bay as well as dozens of secret prisons worldwide, the country began a rapid descent toward becoming the world's freest police state.
America's current malaise is a symptom of an auto-immune disease, an allergic reaction to 9/11 sparked by a neoconservative military still primed against the threats of the Cold War. By treating Terrorism as monolithically as the Red Menace, the White House birthed a bastard foreign policy. Put simply, the Bush Doctrine might read like this: America will protect the free world from global terror, even if this means violating another state's sovereignty if it aids and abets terrorists; America will strike first to prevent the terrorists from winning. Seven years of hindsight have shown the real worth of these policies. Still, clarifying the confusion clouding the word "terrorist" is necessary. Who are these phantoms pursued in the wilds of Wazirstan by NATO soldiers?
<strong>
Think globally, bomb locally
</strong>
The mountains surrounding the fabled Khyber Pass are dotted with dusty villages and bunkers. For hundreds of years, the indigenous Pashtun tribes have resisted foreign domination and occupation. In 1842, the British sent a 14,000-man army to quell the tribesmen at the frontier of their dominion. Only one man returned, part of his skull shorn off by an Afghan sword. The British never forgot their humiliation; the one survivor later inspired Arthur Conan Doyle's Dr. Watson, disabled veteran of the Afghan wars. The British never took full control and left the independent tribesmen to their own devices. After the birth of Pakistan, the tribal fringe joined as an autonomous region. Although ruled in name by a faraway bureaucrat, here, the elders hold more sway over local affairs than the law.
In this land, AK-47s are known as "Pashtun jewelry," fitting for the rugged warriors who defeated the Soviets in the '80s with covert aid from both the CIA and Pakistan's secret service, the ISI. It is right that the warrior is tolerated, even glorified, by a society under attack. But now that those times are gone, these warriors need a cause to justify their existence. Radical Islam has filled this void.
Islam is the warp and weft of Pashtun culture; it broadly defines their civilization. In this part of the world, Islam binds together Arabs and Persians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, who otherwise despise each other as high-handed or ignorant. For these tribesmen, ideology is irrelevant because it does not motivate their political cause; rather, it justifies it. Their Islamist ideology is the banner waved by their movement, not its impetus. The same forces that bound the West into NATO and unified the fringes of the global socialist revolution during the 20th century are at work.
As with communism, the ideology is more viable than the movement. The newly proclaimed Islamic Emirate of Wazirstan is doomed to die among a people who don't want to give up their independence to a capricious military regime. In Pakistan's January election, the moderate Awami party swept the polls at the frontier, not the religious parties. Last week, 42 were killed when militants bombed a meeting of tribal elders in the frontier town of Peshawar. By targeting the institutions of tribal society, the militants are attacking the very culture that tolerated its existence in the first place.
<strong>The war of ideas</strong>
Just as the majority of communist revolutions were spurred by the local desires of oppressed peoples--and not the invisible hand of global revolution or the Soviet Empire--jihadist movements are splintered across the globe, responding to statist oppression through gangland violence. The White House acted blindly after 9/11. A military bred to defeat the invisible threat of global revolution could not understand contemporary geopolitics through any lens but that of a clash of civilizations. Global terrorism is invisible because it shares the same existence as the bogeyman: both are fictions powerful enough to cow those without inside intelligence into obedience. In 2004, talking heads debated the worth of re-electing a "wartime president," and "staying the course." Now, by publicly ignoring the war on terror, the presidential front-runners are giving the people who harbored the terrorists what they want: to be left alone.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DID NOT / DID TOO: IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMISM AND JAPAN&#039;S PROBLEM WITH HISTORY by David Feldmanbe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Japan was given an unexpected shock this past week after a public suicide that left the press hungry for details. On Wednesday, March 5, at 8:15 AM, the usually mundane--and always orderly--session of the Diet, Japan's parliament, was interrupted by an unusual protest from the Right Wing. Brandishing a handgun and two handwritten letters, the still unidentified "activist" stepped out of a cab onto the steps of the Diet building during Tokyo's morning rush hour and shot himself in the head in the midst of the passing crowd. The letters--one addressed to Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, the other to the Japanese media--"urged" the government's reconsideration of the highly divisive issue of the Yasukuni Shrine, a site that honors 2.5 million of Japan's war dead, including, controversially, 14 Class A war criminals that were found guilty (7 were hanged) by the Tokyo Tribunal in 1947.

<!--more-->
The source of the issue's divisiveness: Prime Minister Fukuda is yet to pay his respects in his official government capacity, departing from the precedent of his predecessors and incensing Japan's Right Wing--apparently, to the brink of suicide.
This deadly demonstration is just the latest manifestation of Japan's enduring conservatism regarding interpretations of its guilt for the offenses of the Second World War. Such political extremism, anchored by its control of the popular media, continues to polarize and entrench debates over Japan's wartime past and mar the reputation of Japan in the international arena.
<strong>
Re-defining modern Japan</strong>
Originally commissioned by Emperor Meiji in 1869, the Yasukuni Shrine was built to commemorate the victims of the Imperial Restoration, symbolizing a hard-fought effort to create a modern and globally recognized Japan. For the next 70 years, Yasukuni served as a symbol of state power. Following Japan's surrender in 1945, however, Yasukuni hit a crossroads. In a series of "postwar reforms," the Allied occupiers sought to quell Japan's propensity for militarism by purging the state doctrine of Shintoism. As a result, Yasukuni, a Shinto shrine, was privatized in 1945, and Japan's secularized government has since maintained no connection to it.
So what are Japanese people today to make of Yasukuni's legacy? This most recent episode, and the subsequent media reticence, clearly demonstrates that Japan has lost sight of its pre-war history. Consequently, the history of Yasukuni and its connection to the roots of modern Japan have become concealed by a small clique of militarists, whose presence in the shrine currently taints the entirety of Japan's modern history. It is likely that the thousands of samurai enshrined at Yasukuni, who honorably lost their lives in support of Emperor Meiji during the Boshin War (1868-69), are turning in their graves. This is not to say that those protesting the war criminals' enshrinement are misguided. But Japan's place in modern history goes well beyond the events and misdeeds of its aggressive warfare, something that is not so obvious to younger generations of Japanese and even less obvious to international observers.
Are the crimes committed between 1931 and 1945 so egregious and enduring that they should overshadow Japan's history prior to its aggressive Imperial pursuits? As Japanese pundits continue to squabble over this question they continually miss the point: no interpretation of guilt is absolute. What is more, the whole world is watching them miss this point.
To be sure, the case of Japan stands in marked contrast to modern Germany, where denial of Germany's past misdeeds has become public enemy number one. So what's going on?
<strong>
An intellectual climate of extremism</strong>
The Yasukuni visitation, the suicide and the perpetual media fracas ultimately boil down to personal opinions over Japan's legacy of war and conflict in East Asia. Ask yourself: is Japan still guilty?
Barring Asahi Shimbun, Japan's most liberal newspaper, which was quick to condemn last week's incident as actions "of a man clearly in a disturbed psychological condition," Japan's press has been asking the wrong questions. Both the Left and the Right have for the most part written off this behavior as that of a deranged "Rightist," as though his political orientation were a sufficient explanation for his behavior. Unfortunately, they stop short of the million-dollar question: what are the limits of Japan's extremism?
Regrettably, the press in Japan continues to espouse the mutually exclusive views of either staunch apology or outright denial. This comes as no surprise when one considers the nature of the print media in Japan: the liberal Asahi, the conservative Yomiuri and the ultra-conservative Sankei papers power-sharing in a news-hungry market. Each paper takes a different stance on Japan's guilt: Asahi the apologist, Yomiuri the denier and Sankei ludicrously supporting the notion that the Japan of today is the real victim of these debates.
Surprisingly, the op-ed page of Asahi Shimbun has remained silent, leaving many wondering if, when and how the Left will respond to the suicide. The foreign press has leaned less toward complacency, demonstrating the clear disconnect between the current state of domestic and international perspectives on Japanese guilt. Japan's silence has, sure enough, reinforced the perception in the Western media that Japan's extremism is not just a domestic problem, but becoming the world's as well.
So far the Left has refused to challenge Japan's provocative and outspoken conservatives--advocates of what has been dubbed the "free history" movement (more accurately, the whitewashing of Japan's past). This comes as no surprise when one considers that conservative pundits and "free history" researchers in Japan are well funded, highly publicized (in all media) and highly influential in both the political and social realms. Until either side is willing to concede the malleability of historical truth, we will be left with more of the same maddeningly polarized debate.
Of course the suicide was brash and nonsensical. And of course there is no clear-cut answer for policymakers or Japan's ideologically splintered society. But what will it take to catalyze a candid and constructive debate? The recent coverage of Japan's press does nothing but reinforce the current status quo of entrenched positions on Japan's guilt and squander an opportunity to reflect on the irrationality that grips politics and intellectual life in Japan. The responses of Japan's Left and Right seem to indicate that they aren't ready to answer these questions (let alone ask them), sidestepping what is truly at stake: moving beyond 'postwar' Japan--a moniker that Japanese are growing increasingly tired of.
That Sankei Shimbun regularly prints the outlandish editorials of Fujioka Nobukatsu--a professor of education at Tokyo University considered to be the father of the "free history" movement--clearly demonstrates the ridiculous heights that extremism has reached. Yomiuri and Sankei continually amplify the voices of Japan's right, only to bring Asahi to respond with its opposing view in uncompromising ways. There is no moderate voice in Japan simply because intellectuals refuse to concede that there might, in fact, be many truths as to "what happened."
In the light of war veterans losing face and children growing up in a masochistic society, Sankei's assertion that today's Japanese are the true victims of these debates has one thing right: contemporary citizens are indeed the victims of these debates, as the country inexorably spirals into what is widely known as Japan's rekishi mondai (history problem).
<strong>
To Yasukuni or not to Yasukuni?
</strong>
Thus, we are left with the thorny problem of political symbolism: to Yasukuni or not to Yasukuni--what is a Prime Minister to do? The actions of former Prime Ministers Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe offer us some insight. Koizumi, embattled for nearly five years due to his regular and public visits to the shrine, got more outrage from the international community (namely Taiwan and South Korea) than he gained in support from his Right Wing constituencies. Abe took a different approach. Well aware of the dangers of another public visit and already on a slippery slope toward resignation (which Japan's leadership has a predisposition for), he opted instead for a visit in a "private capacity." Abe shrewdly visited the shrine off the government clock, much to the chagrin of Japan's Right Wing--the very group that propelled him into Koizumi's cabinet and then propped him up as Koizumi's successor.
Fukuda, an established foreign policy dove, has done neither. In fact, he hasn't done anything and is likely to keep it that way. The decision to visit the shrine clearly rests on the priorities of the Prime Minister--forced to strike a balance between party politics and foreign diplomacy. No clear-cut answer exists, and as long as Japan continues to tiptoe around a constructive discussion of its future (as defined by its past), the administration of Japan will continue to be burdened by this unrelenting political tightrope walk.
<strong>
Toward a proud nation?</strong>
What, then, does the story of Yasukuni tell us? Above all else, the story of Yasukuni has come to represent the enduring debate in Japan over pride--both national and individual. This issue, essentially the crux of the debate over collective guilt, has taken many forms throughout the postwar era: textbooks in the '60s, comfort women (a euphemism for women forced into the sexual servitude of the Japanese Imperial army during the Pacific War) in the '90s and, today, Yasukuni.
Should the next generation of Japanese, detached from the memories of the Pacific War, be fostered in an environment of a "masochistic history" devoid of pride, as the Right Wing fears, or should they be forced to bear witness to the misdeeds of Japan's past in order to forge a new, "post-postwar" Japan? This is the essence of the war on history being waged by Japan's intellectual community, one that has without a doubt spilled beyond academic circles and into public life, mass media and the international presses.
If the historian Howard Zinn's mantra of "history as power" remains relevant today, then Japanese intellectuals--beginning with the media--must take the lead in fostering an environment for debate that will unify Japan for the struggles ahead: post-keiretsu economic reform, a declining population, a faltering US alliance and the ever-shifting geopolitical terrain of the Pacific Rim. This stagnant debate is and will remain the greatest hindrance to Japan's effort to move out of the shadows of its past in order to set a new course for the 21st century.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bill Hair's answering machine picks up after six rings. The tinny voice on the other end sounds vaguely familiar. "Hi," it says. "This is Bill and Jenny. Please leave a message after the beep. If you don't... you're fired." Hair, the self-proclaimed world's greatest Donald Trump impersonator, is in character even on his home phone. He entered the look-alike business ten years ago, when his dog breeder pointed out the man's truly striking resemblance--the hazel eyes, the orange helmet of hair. But Hair is confident that he shares more than appearance with Trump, whom he calls "The Donald." In a phone conversation, he explained that they were born 10 days apart and both had lucrative past careers in real estate: "If you believe in astrology at all--and you're a woman, so I'm sure you do--there are really similarities in people when they're born. We share many characteristics; it's just the way it is."

<!--more-->
Tracey Lynne, a Marilyn Monroe look-alike out of DB Magic & Entertainment, grasps at different routes to establish similarity. Tracey hasn't seen the sun in four years, in an effort to get her part-Indian skin as snow-white as Marilyn's. She keeps her hair short enough to fit under the blonde wig that she treats like a baby. She has seriously considered breast implants, since she currently uses padding to recreate Marilyn's curves. Yet she claims that similarity of looks isn't as important as the ability to deeply empathize with the other person. Having read every possible book on the subject, Tracey knows that Marilyn was not without her faults; she was unhealthy, a perfectionist, difficult to work with and thought nothing of being hours late. "Despite all this," she says, "I love her, I love her very much. How can you be someone if you don't love them?"
<strong>Hotties and notties</strong>
Ron Bartels entered the business early on, founding Lookalike-USA, a Boston-based booking agency, in 1984. Ron was a recent college graduate and a disc jockey, spinning records at his local radio station. He saw a Michael Jackson impersonator perform at a club one night. Struck by the business potential, he collaborated with "Jackson," and slowly started building up his own "stable of look-alikes." He pulled names right off the records he was playing--Billy Idol, Cindy Lauper, Bruce Springsteen. With hooded, smiling eyes and a handsome, streamlined face, Ron himself performed as The Boss and Clint Eastwood, who resemble each other far more than you've probably ever noticed. The business of look-alikes was young, and the new company flourished.
Today, Ron runs Lookalike-USA mostly by himself, with occasional sales help from "Jessica Simpson" and "Bill Murray." Bill Murray's understated humor isn't big party material and Jessica Simpson is never as in demand as her more outrageous peers, so their look-alikes need to pull in the extra income. If Jessica and Bill aren't in high demand, who is? Elvis and Marilyn are eternal. Johnny Depp and Paris Hilton are hot. Sinatra and Bond are classy. Bush and Clinton are timely. They sell hair supplies at corporate trade shows, pose seductively in Korean cell phone commercials, sing toasts at retirement celebrations and greet retirees off of Newport cruise ships.
But not just anyone can pull off that celebrity magic. One corner of the Rockland, MA office is dubbed "the Wall of Shame." Here, the photos of certain wannabe look-alikes come to rest. The sixty-year old woman who says she can do Marilyn Monroe. "Marilyn died at thirty," Ron says with a snort. And then there's the man who claims he looks like Mel Gibson. "Oh yeah, you have his right eyebrow, that's it," scoffs Ron. It's a tight business, impersonating people whose faces are incredibly well known, and Ron plucks only from the A-list.
<strong>
Method acting</strong>
At events, Derek Williams, a UK-based Sven-Goran Eriksson (one of Europe's most famous soccer managers) impersonator, tries to strike a balance between "being the character while relying on one's own wits to invent original and entertaining dialogue." He notes that a look-alike must provide far more entertainment value than the celebrity would at the same event.
Without inherent star cachet, look-alikes must "work their socks off all night" to be fun. Tracey Lynne will do whatever it takes to sell herself. When describing what she does at parties, she breaks into character, her voice soaring to Marilyn's flighty heights. Asked her name, she answers, "My name is Marilyn, silly." When pressed further: "I talk about Joe, how I love Joe very much, Bobby and Jack were okay, but Joe." However, if the conversation gets much deeper than that, Tracey will admit her own name and connect on a more personal level. Listening to both Tracey and Derek, their need to find equilibrium between the self and the celebrity, the performer and the person, shines through.
Bill Hair worries much less about self/celebrity, performer/person mumbo jumbo. He finds it easy to get into character because, like his double, he's used to mixing with people. For him, it's not about balance; it's about exploiting what he already has in common with Trump. "I talk about anything you want. I'm very well-educated--I've been an aeronautical engineer and a pilot, I collect fine art, restore rare automobiles, I've written a gourmet Italian cookbook."
At least Trump has interests to exploit. Ron Bartels is shocked that "Paris Hilton," a persona without any particular entertainment value, is currently Lookalike-USA's most popular female look-alike. According to him, when "Paris" comes to your party, she, well, impersonates Paris: "She hangs around, drinks, pretends she's text messaging her friends, smiles, says 'Nice dress' and 'You're hot.'" She's particularly requested for kids' parties and bar mitzvahs. "I don't know why anyone would pay money for these things," he exclaims.
For Jo Wiskin, the founder of Lookalikes-Unite, a UK-based non-profit that promotes look-alikes, it's easy to understand why. She explains that celebrities make people happy. Most people can't meet celebrities. Lookalikes are cheaper than celebrities. Lookalikes make people happy. Bill agrees with this and will sometimes even break the golden rule of impersonation by not correcting fans who approach him in public. Recently, while leaving a California luncheon, he was stopped by a turnstile attendant. The attendant gushed, "Oh God Mr. Trump, you're the greatest man in the world," so Bill gave him a headshot and drove away. "I don't tell them I'm not Donald Trump. I let them enjoy it, let them go home with a happy feeling. There's no harm."
<strong>
Magic, deception and a male Joan Rivers
</strong>
Look-alikes and their agents fight for respect in an industry where they're more likely to be linked with tabloids and Vegas than talent and Hollywood. Kerry Ferris, a sociologist at Northern Illinois University, is one of the few researchers on celebrity impersonation. She says that most look-alikes are initially entertainers and artists, seeking recognition themselves, who exploit their resemblances to the famous to make ends meet. Few dream of becoming impersonators, she claims. It's a job and it takes work.
Tracey says that even Marilyn didn't look like Marilyn. "Sometimes, she took as many as nine hours to get into her Marilyn persona. Her voice wasn't really like that. When she would walk around in a brown wig, no one would notice her." And Derek recounts a famous anecdote in which Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest and won third place. Derek explains, "To convincingly 'be' our character, we have to be slightly 'larger than life' and 'more real' than the real thing... This is a rare talent which is often unrecognized."
Tracey doesn't completely resemble Marilyn Monroe, but she's mastered the art of "being" the star in other ways. She got her start through happenstance. David, her husband of sixteen years, has a beautiful voice. He and his brother even won a Country Music Award in 1989, but when their partnership fell through, he combined magic with his music. One day, his agent called and said, "My Elvis isn't available, I need an Elvis. Can you do it?" So David shaved off his goatee and transformed himself into Elvis. His main routine was magical singing telegrams. Tracey did all his booking, and a customer, responding to her personable phone voice, said, "Tracey, you could do Marilyn." She replied, "No, no I can't, I don't even look like her. I have long brown hair. I can't sing." The customer insisted, so Tracey put on a white dress and a blonde wig and started to get inside Marilyn's head.
When Tracey was younger, she wanted to be "Tracey the Movie Star." No longer destined for Hollywood, Tracey's professional life is now playing Marilyn alongside David's Dean Martin. "I'm doing what I kind of wanted to do," she says. "I just didn't know it would go this way." Tracey and David have a business on the side, a magic trick factory that they run out of their Connecticut home. And it's no surprise that impersonation and magic should go hand in hand--they both provide entertainment through friendly deception.
At the end of our conversation, Tracey sighs, "I would love to walk the red carpet though. God, how awesome." Then she checks herself. "Actually, next week Marilyn will walk a red carpet outside a Pratt & Whitney airport hangar with a male Joan Rivers. I'll be walking the red carpet next week."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The issue of Barack Obama's religious heritage continues to reappear in the most unexpected places, arising less like the mythical phoenix than one of those bald, randomized creatures in a Whack-A-Mole machine. Though the concern has taken many forms--the photograph of the Senator dressed in a Somali turban, the madrassa controversy, Republican Congressman Steve King's assertion that an Obama victory will prompt terrorists to "dance in the streets," even Obama's own middle name--its incarnations all stem from a prejudicial fear among some Americans of electing a 'secret' Muslim candidate. More explicitly, some have argued that Barack Hussein Obama, Jr. poses the threat of becoming an Islamic 'Manchurian Candidate' who intends to destroy America from within. Helping to fuel this rumor is a chain email--made infamous when a Clinton staffer resigned after forwarding it in December 2007--painting in short, histrionic strokes how Obama still harbors Islamic allegiances. The email asserts that Obama was educated in a radical Wahabist school, that he was sworn into office with the Qur'an and (perhaps most childishly) that during the playing of the national anthem, the Senator "turns his back to the flag and slouches." It is nearly impossible to identify a specific genesis for something as easily and invisibly transmitted as a rumor. In the splintered, faceless, funhouse-mirror world of cyberspace, this problem only becomes intensified. However, with regard to this particular rumor, it may be possible to sift through all of the distortions and false replicas to find some original kernel of authorship. It is strangely thrilling to think that perhaps we can pull aside the curtain, just this once, and see the wizard laid bare. His name is Andy Martin. I have looked him in the eyes. And I believe him when he says that he is proud of what he started.

<!--more-->
<strong>
On the genealogy of shady morals</strong>
In an October 2007 article entitled "The New Right-Wing Smear Machine," The Nation's Christopher Hayes sought to trace the electronic lineage of the Obama email. Hayes uncovered that the infamous email was a close paraphrase of an online column written by Right-Wing activist Ted Sampley (of "Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry" fame),who quoted extensively from a public statement made by Andy Martin in 2004.
Martin's statement appears to be the first published allegation that Obama has lied about his religion. Just two weeks after Obama made his Keynote Address at the Democratic convention and rocketed into the national consciousness, Republican senatorial challenger Andy Martin held a series of news conferences in London and New York on August 10, 2004, asking Crown Books to pull all copies ofObama's memoir Dreams of My Father from the shelves on account of factual errors regarding Obama's heritage. Among other things, Martin alleged that Obama was indoctrinated with Islamic values as a child, that his Kenyan family members were being hidden "in a closet somewhere" to conceal their religious beliefs and (on an oddly unrelated note) that Obama's father was a willing participant in Kenya's bloody Mau Mau rebellion. The transcript of this speech lay dormant on the Internet for two years, until Sampley-- inspired by prospects of Senator Obama running for the presidency--began using it as evidence in his piece entitled "Barack Hussein Obama: Who Is He?" for the US Veteran's Dispatch website.
The original press release was classic Martin. The message was spoken before news cameras, printed in an online editorial and emailed to subscribers to Martin's newsletter. Almost everything about Martin is refracted in this fashion. He is not simply a politician, nor is he a journalist. He is both, and neither. He has described himself at various times as an Internet journalist/broadcaster/ critic/litigator/novelist/editor/foreign intelligence analyst/military security consultant/court reformer/corruption fighter/specialist in cyber war tactics. And yes, he is all of those things, and yet none of them.
<strong>The man of many faces</strong>
Martin's personal history is as convoluted and strange as his self-affixed job title. Within the Illinois media, he is most famous for being a perennial candidate in numerous senatorial, gubernatorial and presidential races. Most of his attempts have been spectacular failures. In 1992, his campaign reported earning only $1,060 in donations, $500 of which came from his own mother. In 2004, he lost out to Alan Keyes, who was drafted by the state GOP to ensure that someone precisely like Martin would not get the nomination. In 1998, he conducted senatorial races in Illinois and Florida simultaneously, running under the pseudonym Anthony R. Martin-Trigona in Florida. In that race, he surprisingly carried Miami-Dade County "by a landslide" (his words) and ended up winning 33.6 percent of the statewide Florida GOP vote. By his own count, Martin has run in at least 20 campaigns throughout his lifetime. He has never won, nor has he ever come as close to victory as he did running under a fake name in a state in which he did not reside.
He is also a prolific Internet columnist, having published hundreds of editorials ranging from a detailed peace plan for the Middle East to a cringe-worthy lyrical ballad to Paris Hilton set to the tune of "You Are My Sunshine." Following his initial article on Obama's "Muslim roots," Martin has published dozens more focusing on everything from Obama's grandmother to his "dishonest" use of a teleprompter during his Iowa victory speech.
Reading his press releases, one gets the feeling that Martin runs for public office not to promote himself so much as to disparage everyone else. The man is an animal of dissent. He rages against everything, in all directions and in nearly every medium (radio, television, legal, electronic--all, it seems, except legitimate print journalism). It was only a matter of time before his volley of arrows struck upon something or someone who mattered.
<strong>A portrait of the hack journalist as a young man
</strong>
Seeing how often he has been burned by the local press, one would assume that Andy Martin would shy away from prying young journalists. This assumption turns out to be incorrect. Write an email to Andymart20@aol.com, at any time of day, and I promise he will respond within hours. I began my correspondence with him in December 2007 with a series of blunt, angry emails addressing his baseless misrepresentation of Obama's religion. He responded promptly and viciously. After a brief, frothy back-andforth, I told him that I enjoyed his candor, and respectfully requested an interview. Amazingly--considering the open hostility I had shown him just days before--he agreed.
The morning I was scheduled to drive into Chicago to meet with Andy, I opened my door to find that my dad (having read for years about Martin's antics in The Chicago Tribune) had placed outside my bedroom door one electric stun gun and one switchblade knife. Attached was a note: Pick one. The precaution was unwarranted. For all his flaws, Andy Martin is not known to be a violent man. But then again, Martin had served a brief stint on Riker's Island (for infuriating a judge and instigating some kind of bizarre courthouse brawl). Needless to say, I chose the switchblade.
Martin kept me waiting for two hours in the lobby of his posh Huron Avenue office building. He wouldn't allow me to come up to his office, but according to the security guard, Martin really does rent an office space and show up to work most days. (How he earns money is another great Martin mystery, since his website doesn't advertise and he doesn't have a second job. Many on the web suspect he still receives support from his mother.)
Just as I was beginning to suspect he had blown me off entirely, Martin stepped in from the bitter Chicago cold, wearing a knee-length Gore-Tex jacket and a wool hat and apologizing for his tardiness. With graying hair and a pink, wind-chapped face, he was notably unnotable. The crazed, malign twinkle I had expected to see in his eye was entirely absent. He looked like nothing so much as a jolly first-time grandfather.
Over hot chocolates at a nearby Star-bucks, I found that Martin was indeed jolly, almost calculatedly so. In a near-constant two-hour ebullient monologue (into which I had the opportunity to insert only four questions, all of which he evaded), he regaled me with stories of single-handedly hunting for Saddam in Baghdad in 2003, his days chasing girls at the University of Illinois and how he was currently suing a reporter at the Tribune "just to drive him crazy." The impression I got was that this man, whose vicious rumor-mongering continues to dog the heels of a historic presidential candidate, was not a political mastermind so much as a merry prankster, like a child enraptured by his own ability to disrupt the adult world.
<strong>
Who you callin' blogger?</strong>
Martin is quick to point out that he writes "editorials," not "blogs," and that there is an important difference. Indeed, something in Martin's tone and style makes it seem inaccurate to label his writing as blogwork. It would also be unfair to call it traditional journalism. To coin a term, what Martin practices could perhaps be called "iJournalism." With its Internet-only platform, egoistic ("I"-heavy) narrative style and eschewal of the staples of old journalism--research, fact-checking, and objectivity--his brand of writing is perfectly suited to an intellectually lazy,
gossip-hungry internet peruser. (The genre has its obvious antecedents, most notably in the work of Matt Drudge during the 1990's.) Martin brings to online journalism what Rush Limbaugh brought to radio or Michael Moore to film: sleek little stories that fit into larger political narratives, with all uncooperative details shaved away and any cracks filled in with the occasional white lie.
When asked to provide evidence that Obama practiced Islam as a child, Martin responded, "When you go to a gourmet restaurant, do you ask the chef for his recipes? Of course not." He went on: "My factual allegations about Obama have been vetted around the world and have held up. [Author's note: this is not true.] Where you lack insight is that you fail to understand how my worldwide and world-wise experience told me where to look and what to look for. Obama's people don't even dispute my facts. [Also untrue.] What distinguishes an artist from a hack is how we draw conclusions and whether those conclusions stand the test of time. Mine have."
<strong>
Reinventing bullshit</strong>
Unreliable, opinion-based journalism is admittedly nothing new. It dates back to the yellow journalism of the 1890s and beyond. What's new is a structure of information distribution that allows an individual man, without the aid of any major media outlet, to reach so many and influence so much. By disguising his opinions within the aesthetic framework of a 'respectable' news website, Martin is able to garner journalistic authority that would normally be denied to a fringe reporter with unreliable sources (in other words, a blogger). As traditional print journalists increasingly move from real-world research to web-based research, pieces of iJournalism are often picked up and used as textual evidence and inspiration for larger media narratives. In light of this trend, Martin seems more interested in having his story appropriated by media outlets than in bolstering his own readership.
In Martin's lexicon, the marker of success is "influence," the value of a piece of writing is "impact," the test of its authority, "vetting." Even if a particular article is later found to be false (as the madrassa scandal soon was), this does nothing to downgrade the influence of the iJournalist, because his name has become that much more recognizable. Martin's particular genius has been to provide a wealth of potential raw data for the media to stumble upon. Through the guises of politician, attorney and foreign affairs analyst, Martin has been able to keep his name in the Chicago headlines with surprising success over the last 20 years. And since he writes the headlines on his website, Martin ensures that at least one a day bears his name.
Asked if whether his political aspirations were possibly tainting the objectivity of his reporting, Martin laughed and shook his head. "Objectivity?" he quipped incredulously. "There is no objectivity... There is just my opinion and yours."
Politician or journalist. Prophet or prevaricator. Artist or hack. Sitting across the table from the wavering imago of Andy Martin, these distinctions don't just become blurred; they no longer seem worth drawing at all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been over a month since thieves jacked four masterpieces from the EG B√ºhrle Foundation, an art collection outside Zurich, Switzerland. Wearing ski masks and toting pistols, two men unhooked the paintings, stuffed them into carpetbags and disappeared with art worth over $163 million. A week later, two of the four paintings were found--thanks to either dumb luck or dumb crooks. Not far from the gallery, C√©zanne's Boy in the Red Waistcoat and Monet's Poppy Field at V√©theuil were tucked quietly in a car's backseat in a mental hospital's parking lot. Van Gogh's Blooming Chestnut Branches and Degas' Ludovic Lepic and his Daughter are still missing. Interpol estimates only an eight percent recovery rate for stolen paintings, so it's likely that they won't surface.

<!--more-->
The best hope for Zurich lies in the Art Loss Register, an international online database of stolen art, antiques and collectibles. Established in 1991 by auction houses and insurance agents, ALR keeps track of all missing artifacts; buyers can search the catalogue before any purchase, forcing sellers to show proof of authenticity or legitimate provenance. ALR also offers search and recovery services to collectors. An art detective, Ingrid Blom-B√∂er, has been assigned to the Zurich case.
Contrary to popular mythology, there are no evil art aficionados holding cocktail parties to show their recently pinched Rembrandts. "These paintings will probably act as currency in a sort of underworld of organized crime gangs," Blom-B√∂er said in an interview with SwissInfo.com. "They may be used in payment or exchange for money laundering purposes or in connection with drugs and weapon trafficking." Stolen paintings can also be "art-napped, " held for a ransom with the intent to blackmail insurance companies. Sometimes, when the painting is recognizable, it gets stashed in an attic until the owner gets bold enough--or bored enough--to sell it years later. Art theft for the sake of art is rare.
<strong>
Grand Theft Art</strong>
When burglars tiptoed into the Mexico City National Museum of Anthropology on Christmas Eve in 1985, they almost tripped over the eight security guards, all of whom had fallen asleep on the floor after a merry evening of drinking. Art theft isn't usually this easy. Caper films accurately depict the careful months of necessary planning. Thieves must scope out vulnerable paintings, brainstorm how to make their move, decide a tactic and pick the right time. It's like planning a first date; maybe when Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911, he wanted to take her out for espresso, not back to Italy.
Considering few thieves have been caught, their specific motives are largely unknown. In Zurich, the perpetrators may have ditched the C√©zanne and the Monet because they suddenly needed to travel light. Or they may have been aiming only for the Degas and the Van Gogh. "If you follow large important auctions you know exactly what these paintings are worth, and that attracts the interest of criminals," Blom-B√∂er explained. "The thieves are not taking the paintings to enjoy them. They have different goals."
Someone always wants to make a profit, and since a large part of the art trade is still highly unregulated, stolen works of art often change hands for large sums. Even in the case of English sculptor Henry Moore's two-ton bronze statue Reclining Figure, which was lifted from a museum yard using a flatbed truck, money was a factor. Moore's statue, worth $5.2 million, probably wasn't sold, but rather melted down for scrap metal.
<strong>
A past of plundering</strong>
There is one instance of embezzlement in the name of love: St√©phane Breitwieser, an introverted French writer, stumbled across a painting, became deeply infatuated and took it right from its small gallery. From there, Breitwieser became a kleptomaniac art buff. Throughout the '90s, he exploited relaxed security, tucking canvases in his overcoat and hiding artifacts in his knapsack. His first serious museum theft was a crossbow. Over the years, he stole 232 items from 139 museums and galleries across Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland. But Breitwieser never sold any of the art. Instead, he hoarded the treasures in his bedroom in his mother's house. All the artwork was stored carefully, and he even re-framed several pieces. One painting, Francois Boucher's Sleeping Shepherd, was kept under his pillow.
After six years, Breitwieser was finally caught snatching a 16th-century bugle from a museum in Switzerland. At first, police assumed it was a one-time thing, only a petty theft. Soon, reports from around Europe against Breitwieser flooded in, revealing the intensity of his pathological enthusiasm. It took almost three weeks for the Swiss authorities to get an international search warrant, and by that time Breitwieser's mother, Marielle Stengel, had destroyed the majority of the art back in France. Although authorities believed that she was getting rid of the evidence, Stengel insisted that she was teaching her son a lesson when she shredded his favorite Boucher painting in the garbage disposal. She cut other paintings into pieces with tiny scissors and tossed classical artifacts into the nearby Rhine-Rhone canal, ruining several thousand dollars worth of art.
In 2006--long after he had served 26 months in jail--Breitwieser released a book, Confessions d'un Voleur d'Art (Confessions of an Art Thief). For Breitwieser, art theft was a fanatical pastime. Driven by love instead of money, Breitwieser may have been one of the most industrious art thieves in history. But he got caught.
<strong>
Someone's gonna miss it
</strong>
Most recovery stories don't end in the Breitwieser brand of tragedy. In fact, if pieces are going to show up, they'll surface over time. It just takes a while. In 1967, an Andrew Wyeth watercolor vanished from the front room of the Sears-Vincent Price Gallery--a short-lived collaboration between the department store and horror film actor--in Chicago. Thirty years later, the painting arrived at Christie's, where a researcher investigating its provenance realized it was still considered stolen.
Thirty years for a Wyeth may be nothing in comparison to the Isabella Gardener Museum theft in Boston; that attempted recovery could last for generations. During his successful career, Harold J. Smith, art investigator for Christie's and Lloyd's of London, uncovered fake Michelangelos and Picassos. It's debatable whether Harold J. Smith is best known for his appearance in the 2005 Rebecca Dreyfus documentary Stolen, his cracking of the spectacular Florida gold robbery or his signature bowler hat, eye-patch and prosthetic nose. After the Gardener Museum robbery--in which a Vermeer and three Rembrandts were taken--Smith became obsessed with the case but, sadly, made absolutely no headway. Now that he is retired, his son and grandson will continue the search.
Since its inception, the Art Loss Register has notably recovered C√©zanne's Still Life With Fruit and a Jug and Picasso's Woman in White Reading a Book. ALR encourages registration on the database in order to develop an extensive catalogue, which will not only help future cases, but also reveal a chain of art buyers and sellers. As ALR grows, it could act as a significant deterrent for art thieves, upping their risk significantly.
Arguably, one preventive measure against theft would be better security. Small European galleries--like the ones Breitwieser targeted--skimp on security in favor of purchasing higher-value acquisitions. When thieves seized Munch's The Scream from the National Gallery in Olso, Norway in 1994, they made sure to leave a note: "Thanks for the poor security."
<strong>Gimme Monet for Degas</strong>
Blooming Chestnut Branches and Ludovic Lepic and his Daughters have been entered into the Art Loss Register. Blom-B√∂er believes that "thieves think that after the publicity dies down, no one will remember anything about this theft." She's probably right. Art heists captivate our cultural imagination, but only briefly. We like our elegant crimes committed by elegant people. In films like The Thomas Crown Affair, we cast Pierce Brosnan as our dandified bandit and shoot Renee Russo's buttocks crisp and still, like C√©zanne apples. When Catherine Zeta-Jones booty-shimmied through some lasers, Entrapment raked in over $210 million. But the spectacle is fleeting and forgettable. The best hope for Zurich may lie in waiting for the paintings until some bored criminal gets an itch in his wallet.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HEADY DAYS, VIGOROUS NIGHTS: AN ACTOR&#039;S MEMOIR by Aaron Cutler</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The minute I saw that I'd been cast as a talking vagina, I knew that things were going well. The show was the student-written The Karaoke Kid, and I accepted the part because I'd been on a cold streak. Once the cream of freshman thespians, I had curdled over four bad auditions, culminating with a failed bid to get into Cannibal! The Musical.

<!--more-->
Actors are desperate. They tell themselves anything to turn a situation their way. I told myself I had a responsibility. I'd be the best talking pussy that Brown had ever seen.
<strong>
There's no business</strong>
Poplar Duvet, The Karaoke Kid's main character, is a small-town girl with big dreams. She wants to be a karaoke star and has all the hopes of anyone who appears on the burgeoning Fox reality series that the playwright liberally borrowed from. She is also sexually frustrated, and in a dream sequence the curly-haired V-Face appears before her. I would wear pink, hold a pink hand puppet, smoke a cigarette, talk like Michael Jackson and enter to the tune of "Got to Be Starting Something." I had my work cut out for me.
Like any good actor, I began with research. I'm Jewish, so the curly hair was no problem. I didn't smoke cigarettes, but I could learn how to hold one. I bought a made-for-VH1 movie called Man in the Mirror and repeated the Michael Jackson character's lines until I freaked out my roommate.
V-Face's body was a different matter. How to move like him, act like him, be him, I simply didn't know. I looked for works of art to draw upon. There was Me and Him, a movie about a talking penis, but no equivalent for the female anatomy. My writer-director, Caitlin, a big-hearted matron who every once in a while threatened to blackball me from Brown theater, recommended I go to the Sarah Doyle Women's Center.
I walked into the Center on a Tuesday afternoon, taking extra care to ensure that nobody saw me. The receptionist was only a year or two older than me, I think, but I'm not sure because I tried not to look at her. "Excuse me, do you have any pictures of vaginas that I could look at?" I asked, with my head down.
She stared at me.
"It's for a play."
She went into the back while I glanced at abstract student paintings. She returned with a black-and-white drawing with each part clearly labeled. V-Face was more complicated than I had thought.
I said, "I've never seen one of these in person before."
"It's a picture."
I nodded slowly and thought about how to phrase my next question. I finally came out with it.
"Do you mind if I take this with me?"
<strong>Must go on
</strong>
I worked extra-hard during the next two weeks. I danced to Michael Jackson songs while smoking imaginary cigarettes. My roommate looked on, confused. Each night I got into bed and stared at the picture, thinking, I am V-Face.
Four days before opening I came to rehearsal in tight jeans and a tucked-in T-shirt. For some reason I thought this was an awfully good idea. I still didn't have my puppet, but I approached Caitlin enthusiastically to ask if we could run my dance number. I had moves to show her. She told me to wait.
Once the cast had walked in she made us all go upstairs. We sat in a circle. There were changes to the script, she said. "Does everyone have their pencils?"
We nodded.
"Okay... Pages 28 to 33, crossed out!"
My big break was gone. She smiled happily at me. I died inside.
Later on she said that she had cut the pages for the show, but if you asked me I'd tell you that the puppet-makers were buffoons (our whole crew was iffy--Caitlin fired our prop master, who had been working for free). I contented myself with a less flashy role as Poplar's doctor, who spoke like a Terms of Endearment reject ("Na-ow, Miss Duvet..."). Our posters didn't go up until the next-to-last day of performances, which was just as well, since it meant that all the friends to whom I'd bragged about my part would miss the show.
I've acted in other shows at Brown since then, but my lost opportunity haunts me still. Looking back on Karaoke Kid, I don't know which was sadder: that I was cast as a vagina, or that I never got to play it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh be merciful, ye Furies, ye spectres, ye angry shades!" Orpheus is on his way to the underworld to retrieve Eurydice, his recently deceased wife. "NO!" shout the Furies, pretty implacably blocking his way. "May my cruel grief at least earn your pity," he pleads. "NO!" they shout again. "Let yourself be moved by my tears!" he sings, persistent. "NO!" intones a single Fury. The other Furies begin to laugh--they are a good-natured bunch, after all. This particular Fury, or rather an unnamed chorus member of Brown Opera Productions' Orfeo ed Eurydice, should not have shouted "NO!" at this particular moment. He should have waited a few measures more. He has screwed up, conspicuously.

<!--more-->
The laughter, however, is not entirely directed at him: it's opera, really, that is funny, ridiculous, absurd. What would possess a group of recalcitrant Furies to sing "NO!" together in a G minor chord, and then in a B-flat major chord, and then again an F major chord? Why does it take an hour and a half for Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera to tell the barest-boned version of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth? Why does Orpheus, belting lines over an orchestra to the depths of the opera hall, think he is successfully keeping a secret from Eurydice standing just next to him? What's that orchestra doing in Hades, anyway? Opera is preposterous--Orfeo ed Eurydice is actually a relatively sober example--yet despite this it is also superb, beautiful, fascinating.
<strong>
Orpheus shreds</strong>
The Furies relent soon enough, of course, momentarily suspending their fury. For Orpheus alone they make an exception, as does everybody who hears him sing. He was the inventor and master of the lyre, as well the first singer-songwriter, and he has never had an equal. In the myths, trees uproot themselves to follow his melodious ambulations, beasts forget to be beastly and stones forget to be solid, rivers run awry and mountains move. Time itself passes more easily and limbs resist fatigue, as the Argonauts discover when Jason has Orpheus sing to them as they row; they hardly even notice the Sirens as they sail past that perilous isle.
In the most familiar myth, Orpheus' wife, Eurydice, dies on the day of their marriage. His tuneful laments cause all the gods to weep, and on their advice he travels to the underworld to retrieve her. In Gluck's opera, he charms the Furies with his song; in various other versions of the tale, he does the same with Charon, Cerebrus, Hades and Persephone. Orpheus finds Eurydice, but in order to lead her back to the world of the living he must abstain both from looking at her and from explaining this abstention. Up to this point, animals, mortals and gods have made exceptions for Orpheus' sake, putting into suspension universal laws, logics and ontologies. Now it is Orpheus who, in withholding his gaze, must suspend his desire for Eurydice and his disbelief of her presence. He fails to do so, and Eurydice dies a second death.
Modern retellings of the myth abound. Sonia Nayak, member of the BOP Board and a star of last year's production of Goyescas, writes excitedly that this story "has penetrated our culture through fables, plays and contemporary interpretations." She gives some examples: "Sarah Ruhl's play Eurydice, poems by Rainer Maria Rilke called Sonnets to Orpheus, Tennessee Williams' play Orpheus Descending, a film by Jean Cocteau called Orph√©e, another by Marcel Camus called Orfeo Negro..." Her ellipses imply that the list goes on, and it certainly does.
<strong>Orpheus and Opera</strong>
The tale, however, has been a favorite subject of opera in particular, and of historically significant operas especially. More than 15 composers have written operas with the Orpheus myth as their subject matter, including Telemann, Haydn, Offenbach, Milhaud and Philip Glass. Claudio Monteverdi's 1607 L'Orfeo is often considered to be the first opera ever written, or at least the first extraordinary one--it is one of the few from that period still performed today. Gluck's 1762 Orfeo ed Euridice is significant not just for its beauty and enduring popularity, but also as the first of his three "reform operas." These, accompanied by a 1767 manifesto written by Gluck and his librettist, Ranieri de' Calzabigi, enacted a number of important changes which were to have a profound influence on the way later composers, including Mozart and Wagner, wrote opera. The changes intended to display opera's potential for musical and theatrical effect, which at the time was obscured by a paralysis of form and a dominating focus on the talent and flair of individual singers.
In Orfeo ed Eurydice, the entirety of Orpheus' life up to and including his marriage is conveyed by a cheerful three-minute overture, and a simplified version of the main myth is presented in three acts. In the first, Eurydice is dead, Orpheus mourns, and Amore (Cupid) proposes to him the traditional deal. In the second, Orpheus finds Eurydice in the underworld. In the third, after Orpheus looks back at Eurydice and thereby kills her, the story gets warped a bit: Orpheus is about to commit suicide when Amore enters to tell him he has suffered enough for her glory. She then brings Eurydice back to life, and everyone comes on stage to sing about the triumph of love.
You'll notice that a female sings the part of Orfeo in BOP's upcoming production. The reason is historical, and the history is tortuous. Gluck's original 1762 edition had a castrato--a castrated male--singing Orfeo; the last of these died in 1922, so that option was out of the question for the BOP. In 1774, when the opera was translated into French, Gluck rewrote Orfeo's part for haute-contre. Jordan Elkind of BOP explained that the exceeding rarity of this voice type, which enters the highest stratosphere of the male range, made this option also unfeasible. An 1859 edition rewritten by Hector Berlioz combined elements of the two earlier ones and gave the role of Orfeo to a female alto; the problem for BOP here was that Berlioz called for a larger orchestra, which, given Alumnae Hall's acoustics, would have covered up the singers. In the late 19th century, a number of editors began producing yet more hybrid versions of the opera; BOP settled on what Jordan hesitatingly calls the "canonical hybrid version," published in 1889 by the Ricordi company. Drawing material from the 1774 and 1859 versions, it translated the French back into Italian and transposed Orfeo's role for mezzo-soprano. "With so many versions floating around," says Jordan, "making the decision of which to stage becomes a creative process."
<strong>Operacademia</strong>
The over-exuberant Fury's untimely exclamation had interrupted rehearsal for at most a minute; I was probably the only one still distracted half an hour later. I was preoccupied with opera's fundamental silliness, but beyond this, opera is something to be taken seriously in what it means and what it can do. I first became aware of these issues, along with the scholarly apparatus that deals with them, two years ago at a conference presented by the Cogut Center for the Humanities.
Entitled "Unsettling Opera," it had an outstanding cast of opera scholars, journalists, producers and directors explore "the conceptual demands and visceral power of opera in performance." Of the four productions they discussed, a particularly intriguing one was Patrice Ch√©reau's 1976 Bayreuth production of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung. The French director had been invited to produce the tetralogy for the centennial celebration of the Wagner's Bayreuth Festival Theatre, but when he set the gargantuan mythic opera in the grime of the Industrial Revolution, pandemonium ensued. The orchestra openly rebelled, altercations in the audience turned bloody and a howl of rage greeted the producers at their curtain call. The highlight of the conference, though, was director Peter Sellars, present in person to discuss his 1989 production of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, which he had set in New York City's Trump Tower. (He has also placed Cosi Fan Tutti in a Cape Cod Diner and Don Giovanni in Spanish Harlem, with a Vietnam vet and a drug lord in the respective lead roles.)
This discussion will be continued this Thursday and Friday in the Cogut Center's upcoming conference, "Wagner and Scandal: A Rigorous Conversation with Music Drama." The promotional poster shows an image from Katharina Wagner's recent Bayreuth production of Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. In it, grotesque and grubby green-masked men point accusingly at a suited figure slouched in a cheap desk chair. The production was, of course, a scandal; this conference will provoke us to wonder why.
<strong>Orpheus and Eurydice as Opera</strong>
I too have a serious, though not so scandalous, question to ask: why the obsession of opera with the story of Orpheus? The simple answer could be that he demonstrates the power of music--after all, what better subject matter for music than the power of music itself? But the reason is more sly than this. It lies in the fact that opera, more than most theatre or cinematic arts, must at every moment demand an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief from its audience, insistently asking its audience to make an exception to its primary conceit, its inherent illogic, its underlying and humorous absurdity.
That the myth of Orpheus directly thematizes suspension and exception cannot be a coincidence. Even the most peripheral of the Orpheus legends involve an exception of some sort, made by nature, gods or other figures. In Orpheus' descent in pursuit of Eurydice, the distinction between death and life is twice suspended: he, living, is allowed into the realm of death, and she, dead, is given the chance of a second life. During their ascent, it is Orpheus' failure to suspend his desire that causes the return of death. He looks back, and her life is over; we look around, distracted by the absurdity of the spectacle, and opera is over. We learn to make exceptions for Orpheus' sake and to suspend our disbelief for Eurydice's. Opera returns again and again to the myth of Orpheus as a means of reinforcing its audiences' capacity for exception and suspension--fundamental faculties for our ability to delight in opera as we so much wish to do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Devastations</strong>
<em>
Yes, U</em>
<strong>[Beggar's Banquet, 2008]</strong>
Yes, U, the third offering from Berlin-via-Melbourne trio Devastations, confounded a basic understanding I had about music appreciation. My thought: albums, in their irreducible linearity, force a listener to forward march through their content. Perhaps we restart a song here and there, but only haphazardly and halfheartedly. Singles sidestep this, as do iTunes and blog-based listening, which focus entirely on the ad infinitum potential of any one selection. But albums, if we're to respect or grasp them as a form, require a listen start-to-finish.

<!--more-->
In this regard, Yes, U made no sense. Not at first, anyway. The songs' schizophrenia was too scary, too disparate, to fit together; the murky minimalism and dark atmospherics cohered only in superficial respects: chugging bass lines, scratched sound waves sailing 'round, double-tracked vocals. There were flamenco overtones and Spanish guitars, krautrock electro-dronings, melodramatic titles like "As Sparks Fly Upwards" and "The Avalanche of Stars." And what does one do, then, with the near-pop chorus of "Mistakes" or the "sha-la-las" of "The Face of Love"?
No, not until I hit the album's closer, a five-minute warbling tango entitled "Misericordia" (Spanish for mercy), could I find a handle. The song circles around its central theme, played on what sounds like a Wurlitzer organ, always close to resolution but never delivering on something as simple as the desire for it. Instead, it spins into entropy with increasingly distorted layers of ambience, then washes away the extra noise and ends--simply and on its own terms. Still, mercy is at its core; even as the song frustrates throughout, it satisfies with grace.
Hence the album's cyclic conceit. This is not one to move through; it is one that surrounds you, subsumes you, builds upon itself with the barest of bones. Shadows emerge everywhere on Yes, U (as in the haunting "The Pest"), but minimalism here is no progenitor of lack--rather a source of all kinds of negative space to hide inside. "Rosa" bursts open but resists a wildly flailing crescendo, instead controlling itself and enjoining its title character to believe in the good of something, asking "can't you feel your heart beating?" "Avalanche of Love" and "The Saddest Sound" employ some thematic tactics of Leonard Cohen's later work, along with his baritone vocal styling and synth flirtations.
While Yes, U's songs don't quite stand alone or in a line, "Misericordia" acts as the mortar between the bricks--the proper context for all the others--inducing repetition in order to fill in the spaces left by each previous listen-through. In this, the album soothes; it's not perfect--at various points its plodding starkness approaches a kind of grown-up goth-hood--but its effect is undeniable. Conrad Standish sings in the penultimate track that "the saddest sound [a man can hear] is nothing." Yes, U strips down its songs until that possibility nears; its mercy insists that as long as you cycle through, you won't be condemned to such a fate.

<strong>WHY?</strong>
<em>Alopecia
</em>
[Anticon, 2008]
Alopecia is a medical term for hair loss, possibly resulting in baldness. It is also the third full-length from WHY?, an Oakland three-piece that gives the finger to the concept of genre and turns out brash, inventive tracks full of nervy energy. The backbone of the album lies in its consistently tight beats, giving momentum to what are essentially pop songs. WHY? layers rough-around-the-edges, half-spoken, half-sung rhymes on top of clattering percussion, hushed vocal harmonies and unpretentious guitar and keyboard melodies, crafting a subtle portrait of disillusion, desperation and occasional self-loathing.
Once upon a time, WHY? was the solo project of white-boy indie rapper Yoni Wolf, one-third of the now-defunct experimental hip-hop outfit cLOUDDEAD; the group's current incarnation includes Wolf's brother Josiah and Doug McDiarmid, with Mark Erickson and Andrew Broder of Fog making appearances on this album. Alopecia is a darker but more acoustically and emotionally nuanced take on the style Wolf established with WHY?'s 2003 debut Oaklandazulasylum and fleshed out in their inspired sophomore album, Elephant Eyelash, in 2005. The hip-hop beats that characterize most Anticon Collective projects are more a departure point for Alopecia, which tramps through indie rock and psych-jangle but never settles. There's nothing superfluous here, but every last cranny is filled out with just the right hi-hat tingle or chain-clink or carnival synth line. In songs like "The Hollows," Wolf & Co. let these sounds build up to the breaking point and then some. There are a few moments of earnestness and cheerful bounce reminiscent of Elephant Eyelash, as in "These Few Presidents" and "Fatalist Palmistry," but even then, Wolf's lyrics remind you of the album's underlying bleakness: "I sleep on my back / 'cause it's good for the spine / and coffin rehearsal."
Wolf's lyrical style is raw and self-conscious: he is telling you secrets, speaking in half-rapped dream rhymes. The lyrics are roundabout and weird but manage to convey a passionate intensity: "You're a beautiful and violent word," he laments in "These Few Presidents." These are songs about down-and-out desperation and lost opportunities, about suburban frustration ("If you grew up with white boys / who only look at black and Puerto Rican porno / 'cause they want something that their dad don't got / then you know where you're at.") that culminates with a coke binge in a Starbucks bathroom. At times the lyrics are witty and acerbic enough that you can't help but wonder whether Wolf is mocking his own affected world-weariness. And, well, he is--but that doesn't mean his cynicism isn't for real. He just wants you to feel it in your bones.

		<title>OF CANNIBALISM by David Notis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em> I find that there is nothing barbarous and savage about this nation of cannibals. Every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use in his own country. As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and reason, than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place wherein we live. They are savages at the same rate that we say fruit are wild, which nature produces of herself and by her own ordinary progress; whereas in truth, we ought rather to call those wild, whose natures we have changed by our artifice, and diverted from the common order.
-Michel de Montaigne, "On Cannibalism"
</em>

<!--more-->
Who are we to say what is natural and what is not?  If we can depart, for the sake of objective reason, from the many centuries of inherited customs and behaviors by which our logic is perpetually held captive, it becomes apparent that there is no inherent wrong or barbarism in cannibalism. If a friend of mine practices cannibalism within the privacy of his own estate, I am in no position to pass judgment, nor do I have any desire to do so.
The Critic, believing himself in agreement with this general view, proposes that as a society--a society composed of cannibals and non-cannibals--we must adopt a tacit understanding through which to treat the matter. Under this understanding, one does not ask if another is a cannibal, and the cannibal does not tell another if he is. This succeeds in recognizing that cannibals do exist within the general public, that they are moved to such behaviors through natural inclinations.
Some may dispute this policy, claiming that such a secretive agreement does not treat cannibals fairly. Writes Plutonius the Cynic:
["The Cannibal cannot Tell, he is Mute. The Cannibal cannot be Asked, he is Deaf. No matter the perspective, society is against Him. He is included only to be not included. He is Invisible."]
Such a reaction is unjustified in its blind defense of cannibalism, and the suggestion that the policy of refraining to ask and tell reveals society's calculations to hide cannibalism is unfounded. If one has an acquaintance that He believes a cannibal, He must never appease His curiosity and ask for confirmation and the cannibal must never concede to tell. For if He asked, that would suggest He observed something which He believed to be unnatural, and if the cannibal told, that would suggest the cannibal believes his very nature to be unnatural, which is of course not logically possible, proving that cannibalism and non-cannibalism are equally natural.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have no doubt I was not the only person whose first thought on reading the words "attack on a Hillel employee" in Ruth Simmons' email on Sunday was Maybe it's a coincidence. <em>Please, let it be a coincidence</em>. Within hours, I found out the victim wasn't just any "Hillel employee," but Yossi Knafo, the lone Israeli on staff--employed, no less, as an ambassador from the Jewish Agency for Israel. I couldn't
help but think, wrestling alternately with disgust, distress and anger, that it was seeming ever more unlikely the attack was in any way a 'coincidence.'

<!--more-->
Of course, it could have been. There's no concrete evidence, yet, to confirm that this was anything other than a despicable, cowardly attack. It remains wise to be prudent. Circumstances being what they are, though, it's been hard for everyone to avoid jumping to conclusions. Newspaper headlines progressed from the BDH's "Firebombs thrown at Hillel staffer's house," run Monday morning, to the more evocative "Jewish man target of Molotov cocktail attack" and "Israeli's home hit by Molotovs" run by Providence Eyewitness News and the Providence Journal, respectively, on Monday night. The Anti-Defamation League even issued a press release condemning the firebombing of a "Jewish Agency" in Providence--wording that is not only needlessly provocative, but also misleading, as it was the private home of a Jewish Agency emissary that was attacked. Investigations are still ongoing, as President Simmons and FBI agents have warned, and inflammatory accusations are premature.
And yet the cautious and defensive dialogue surrounding the attack threatens to obscure the very valid emotional response of the affected communities. We hope the attackers picked Yossi's house at random but we fear they targeted him for his religion or nationality. It's not just this possibility itself, but also the maddening lack of clarity, the inability to piece together a coherent story about why this happened, that is making us angry, upset and afraid. While we await the catharsis that the truth, if ever found, would grant us, it makes sense to feel uneasy, so long as we remain reasonable and grounded. For now, we remain in a frustrated limbo where the assailant floats between boor and bigot and the attack itself remains in a hazy zone between simply cruel and genuinely, dangerously hateful. Being trapped in this limbo is surely most difficult for Yossi himself--but, may it be a source of solace, until the full story can
be told, we all remain there with him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>NO LIE: MY LAI</strong>
The Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal that leaked in 2004, the murder of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in 2005 and the ongoing mistreatment of prisoners in Guantanamo have all been called the My Lais of the 21st century. But considering recent events, let's hope they're not. Only this past Sunday-- the 40th anniversary of the 1968 massacre of civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai--audio tapes of a secret 1970 Pentagon inquiry into the US Army's barbarism were finally broadcast. But it doesn't bode well for modern day My Lais that it has taken 40 years for the damning contents of the tapes to hit the airwaves.

<!--more-->
In a BBC news release on March 15, Celina Dunlop, the British journalist responsible for unearthing the My Lai tapes in the US National Archives, wrote, "I spent many months trying to track down the tapes. Again and again, I was told they did not exist but after much persistence, 48 hours of recordings from the key witnesses were declassified and made available to me." Dunlop, who is picture editor of The Economist, maintains that 400 hours of tapes were made and 403 witnesses were interviewed under oath.
Yet, despite not having gained wall-to-wall access to the My Lai archives, Dunlop's findings are the crucial missing link in explaining the dearth of evidence exposed during post-My Lai military tribunals. Since 1968, the My Lai death toll--no fewer than 504 Vietnamese civilians--has been grossly glossed over. Just one soldier, former Lieutenant William Calley, was eventually convicted of murdering 22 Vietnamese villagers during much-publicized court-martial proceedings in 1971. In his final words to the court-martial judge, Calley accounted for his actions by claiming that he had simply "followed orders"--precisely the soldierly defense that the Nuremberg Principles were designed to invalidate. Today, Calley, a retiree and still a classified War Criminal, resides in Atlanta. He has not spoken out against his conviction since his court-martial.
By all appearances, the alleged perpetrators of and witnesses to the My Lai slaughter have been reticent. But the secret My Lai tapes broadcast in the BBC Radio 4 exclusive this weekend shore up another story. Featuring interviews with soldiers and division commanders who took part in the Peers Inquiry (the official Pentagon investigation that preceded the public courts-martial), the tapes reveal why the testimonies have been boxed up for 40 years.
The My Lai tapes evidence the baleful truth: that the massacre wiped out not just one but three villages, My Lai, Binh Tay and My Khe; that two army companies, not just the infamous Charlie company, were involved in perpetrating the massacre; that extensive rape as well as a killing spree occurred that day; and that the slaughter was not brought about by the actions of a faction of renegade soldiers but, rather, premeditated by high-ranking US Army personnel with the aim of securing "a high body count."
The 40th anniversary of My Lai coincides with the fifth anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq this week. The parallels between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq are glaring, yet one connection is less conspicuous: the young Army Major whose responsibility it was to investigate the initial letter that divulged the news of a My Lai cover-up to US Army generals was one Colin Powell.

<strong>100 YEARS OF LIBRARY FINES</strong>
Have you ever worried about racking up late fees? Well, someone in Finland has come up with an interesting solution: wait 100 years. Earlier this month, an unknown patron anonymously returned a century-overdue book to a public library in Vantaa, the fourth largest city in Finland.
The book was so long overdue that the branch of the library to which it was returned did not even exist at the time it was borrowed. Anna-Mari Rantala, head of the Korso district library in Vantaa, admits they do not even keep records of loans that old. In fact, they have no records of books taken out before the early 1950s.
Perhaps the book was so compelling that its possessor couldn't bear to part with it all these years. It was, after all, a 400-page selection of a monthly religious publication known as the Vartija. Who could resist?
Although there are no library records that substantiate this claim, a note attached to the book stated that it had been borrowed around 1900. The note also indicated that at that time, the fee for an overdue book was just 10 pennies per week.
As far as library-goers are concerned, the Finnish are quite an enthusiastic bunch. Today, the Finnish library system serves more than 5.3 million patrons with about 900 libraries. The average Finn goes to the library 11 times per year and takes out close to 20 books in the same period of time, whereas the number of library books borrowed by the average American in 2006 was about seven per year.
In Rhode Island, the maximum fine for failing to return a book to the public library after 60 days is just 25 dollars. The temptation to keep the book--especially if it's one you think you could reread for more than 100 years--may be enticing, but most library users opt for a clean borrowing record.
When an American named Robert Nuranen returned the book Prince of Egypt 47 years late to a public library in Michigan, he faced a late fee of $171.32. Unlike his Finnish counterpart, the seventh-grade social studies teacher paid his fee in order to set an example and to prove that it's never too late to turn in an old library book.
Even if the identity of the mysterious Finnish patron is never discovered, returning the book at all was probably better late than never, as the saying goes. Strange to wonder how many books like the 1902 Vartija or Prince of Egypt are out there being enjoyed by anonymous library-goers at this very moment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every year, Brown spends thousands of dollars on speaking fees for lecturers on topics from human sexuality (Dr. Ruth) to spoken word poetry (Amir Sulaiman). On Tuesday, March 11, the "speaking fee" for the Student Labor Alliance-sponsored Free Trade and Workers' Rights Awareness Series was collected in a passing hat.

The money went to pay the way of Dominican trade union activists Manuel Pujols and Julio Angel Castillo, who delivered a talk in Kassar House on the struggle to unionize and gain respect for workers' rights in the textile factories of the Dominican Free Trade Zone. Pujols and Castillo are the secretary general and secretary of grievances, respectively, of the Sindicato de Trabajadores de TOS (Textile Offshore Site). Brown was the their first stop on a speaking tour across the US to gather international support to pressure Hanes Brand, the apparel company that owns their factory, into respecting workers' rights.

The connection between Dominican textile workers and Brown may not be immediately clear, but asking for the support of American students is not such an odd strategy for those involved in the international apparel industry. Since the 1998 inception of US and Canadian group United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), which helped to arrange Pujols' and Castillo's tour, North American students have joined with labor activists in the US and abroad to bring sweat-free apparel to their campuses and to push universities to stand at the vanguard of advocating a more just apparel industry.

<strong>The freedom of a $1.11 hourly wage</strong>
In the Dominican Republic, where almost all organized workplaces are outside of the textile industry, Pujols' and Castillo's fight for collective bargaining rights has been difficult. Under the Domican Repupblic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, International Labor Organization (ILO) agreements and Dominican law, workers have the right to freedom of association and to collectively bargain. In the lecture, Castillo referenced these guarantees: "There are rules and laws in the Free Trade Zone and agreements under the ILO that say we have rights that must be protected. But the company is not respecting these rights or the workers."

Pujols said he had worked for 20 years in the Dominican Free Trade Zone, and for over two years at the Hanes TOS factory.

He said that since he started work at the factory, the workers have seen both an increase in required working days and a reduction in wages. Employees work 12-hour days, often performing dangerous work. Pujols showed a video of workers bending to move a giant roll of cotton to illustrate why many suffer from back problems. He spoke about coworkers who complain of hearing damage, caused by the noisy environment, and respiratory problems, resulting from exposure to chemicals.

Realizing that Hanes was not fulfilling its contractual obligations, Pujols and Castillo decided to form a union as "the only way to defend themselves" and their coworkers. But deciding to unionize is one thing, and achieving that in an environment openly hostile to union activity another. In order to get a legally recognized bargaining unit, they needed the support of 50 percent plus one of the members of the workforce. In addition, they faced enormous pressure from the company to shut up. Pujols and Castillo said that of the 13 original union organizers, many were bought off in the company's attempt to crush the union. They were offered bribes and individual pay raises in return for giving up the struggle. Said Pujols, "This killed the union, so we [the second wave of activists] had to reform the union beginning from zero." Because the first round of organizers had been bought off and the company continued to threaten and intimidate workers, many were wary of union activity.

Those who remained involved in organizing the union have encountered a lot of prejudice. Castillo spoke of union organizers being shunned in the workplace cafeteria because workers were afraid to be associated with them. Both Pujols and Castillo were fired by the factory and had to take their cases before the Labor Board and Dominican court for wrongful discharge. They were both reinstated, but Castillo claimed he was offered a bribe of $10,000 to cease his activities. He said the company was "sure they could buy us out and kill off the union," adding that the discrimination he has faced "has been incredible." Pujols decried the inaction of the Labor Board, saying, "A union leader in Santo Domingo is treated like a criminal just for defending [his] rights--those rights promised under law and the constitution."

Beyond the struggle to exercise the right to freedom of association, Pujols and Castillo emphasized they are also focusing on reclaiming unpaid wages. They say the company owes over $1.4 million in back pay to those who work 12-hour days but have been paid for only eight hours. They are also gathering signatures to legally authorize a strike. They have over 50 percent of the workers on board, but management still refuses to recognize them as a bargaining unit. In an interview with the Independent, Castillo reiterated, "Organizing is a right. It is not illegal. We are fighting discrimination because we have rights."

<strong>Understanding the acronyms</strong>
The Workers' Rights Awareness Series came on the heels of a USAS and SLA victory at Brown: the President's Cabinet's authorization of the Designated Suppliers Program (DSP). The DSP was designed by universities and student activists to create mechanisms to enforce the labor standards universities have in place. It provides incentive for apparel licencees and their factories to support workers' rights through withholding or granting University licensing contracts. Though in 1999 Brown became the first school to sign on to another USAS program, the Workers' Rights Consortium, the University has lagged behind in choosing to affiliate with the DSP.

Universities have both the obligation and the power to change the apparel industry's treatment of workers. Schools like Brown can help organizers like Pujols and Castillo by using their consumer leverage. Through WRC-coordinated monitoring, factories become designated by adhering to fair labor standards like paying a living wage, providing safe working conditions and allowing freedom of association for workers. They then gain access to university licensing contracts.

"There's really so little space for improvements and to organize [in the apparel industry]," Sarah Adler-Milstein, who provided the translation at Pujols' and Castillo's talk and has been active in the DSP fight at Brown, told the Independent. "Any squeeze room there is to improve wages often gets undermined. The basis [of the DSP] is to use university orders to create any space for... positive worker organizing and actual improvements."

Speaking about criticism of the DSP, Adler-Milstein said, "The argument against it is whether this [initiative] should be coming from the brands themselves, that if it isn't coming from the brands it's never going to have their support." Gaining the support of the brands, or at least pressuring them to be accountable to those who manufacture their apparel, is a primary reason for university involvement. Although university licensing contracts represent a tiny portion of the overall apparel market, Adler-Milstein said, "The really important thing is that universities have an incredible amount of power and have led the way in making space for positive change." In its decision to adopt the DSP, Brown joined other prominent universities, including Columbia, Cornell and the entire University of California system. But for USAS activists, getting those schools, and Brown, to affiliate has been a long struggle.

<strong>Sweatshops out of our Brown sweat-shirts</strong>
Although the Brown University Community Council voted unanimously to join the DSP and have official decision-making power with regard to it, the university administration was not always eager to get on board.

The DSP campaign began in the fall of 2005, when the SLA gathered student signatures and began to negotiate formally with the administration. They formed a working group but could not generate enough pressure to get the DSP passed. The momentum dwindled, with the DSP mired in working-group meetings.

This past fall, Adler-Milstein said, the SLA decided "enough was enough." Students began going to Corporation meetings to generate its support, collected signatures and letters and managed to get over 200 letters of support from parents at Parents' Weekend. They demanded the University take action on the DSP, beyond just agreeing to talk about it. A parent presented the letters to President Simmons at her Parents' Weekend address and asked her to publicly support the DSP. After a two-and-a-half-year SLA struggle and the BUCC's February vote, the President's Cabinet approved the DSP. It will go into effect this fall.

The hope is that Brown's decision will influence other schools nationally and encourage them to affiliate. Walter Hunter, vice president of administration and chief risk officer, who worked with the SLA around the DSP, wrote to the <em>Independent</em> that "despite the fact that 90 percent of the 75 schools with the largest licensing programs have not expressed support for the program," the university believes "that the DSP is an innovative proposal that merits the university's support and that it has the potential of providing sustainable improvements in working conditions for workers producing Brown-licensed apparel."

While Brown works to implement the DSP, Pujols and Castillo continue their speaking tour to New York City high schools, Midwest universities and Washington, DC to meet with FLA representatives. They will end up in North Carolina at Hanes' worldwide headquarters. There, they've secured a meeting with Hanes president Joia Johnson where they will present their evidence regarding the TOS factory and ask her to support the union. The meeting represents a significant victory in their struggle and may have resulted from heightened awareness and student support. With the backing of the kind of student power that mobilized to make the DSP a reality at campuses across the country, Hanes may think twice about defending its union-busting factories.

		<title>HIGH-PROFILE PROSTITUTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FUMBLES THE SPITZER SCANDAL By Britt Harwood Illustration by Susanna Vagt</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you heard about Kristen? Or--sorry--maybe I should call her Ashley Alexandra Dupr√©? If you haven't, you must not have read The New York Times online lately. In a rare demonstration of cop-out research, last week the Times dedicated half a dozen web articles to trivia from the 22year-old's MySpace profile. Just click on one of Ashley's digital headshots (conspicuously taken at arm's length, like most MySpace pics) and you can read about her rebellious teenage years, her struggle to become a pop singer and, most important, her musical influences: Patsy Cline, Frank Sinatra, Christina Aguilera and Lauryn Hill. There are even lyrics from her latest track.

<!--more-->
There is context for the Times' awkwardly voyeuristic profiling. Ashley Alexandra Dupr√© had the misfortune of being tied to former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's fall from grace. Last month, law enforcement officials recorded a telephone transaction between Spitzer and Dupr√©, who worked as a call girl in an elite prostitution ring known as the Emperor's Club VIP. The telephone transactions materialized on February 13, when the (then-) Governor paid thousands of dollars for Dupr√© to travel from New York to Washington, DC to have sex with him in an upscale hotel. Spitzer resigned on March 12, and former lieutenant governor David
A. Paterson took his place on Monday--but this political exchange is less dramatic than the sexual exchange that preempted it.
Spitzer's solicitation is so hypocritical and offensive that it's almost absurd. His reputation casts an irresistible irony over the whole scandal: the Ivy-educated spoiled brat (as Senator Joseph L. Bruno once called him) stormed his way into office as an ethical crusader, exposing bad business and political practices wherever he turned. Journalists in the past week have likened Spitzer's sexual appetite to a "dramatic flaw," as if his exposure and resignation is literarily satisfying, a narrative that brings justice upon a modern
-
gent discourse about prostitution. (Politically minded college students included: this week one friend of mine signed a Facebook message "<3 <3 Client 9 <3 <3," the alias given to Spitzer by the prostitution service, and another affirmed Kristen's hotness after reading her MySpace page.) In the days following Spitzer's exposure, the Times made a fumbling mess of its coverage. In one article, economist Stephen J. Dubner interviewed an anonymous prostitute called "Allie," whom he described as "a very bright and attractive blonde." Dubner's first question: "Have you ever had a client as powerful or well-known as Eliot Spitzer? (You haven't had Spitzer himself as a client, have you?)"
On the same day, the Times featured an op-ed by former call girl and novelist Tracy Quan (the article, in keeping with the tone of the media coverage, was called "Really Dangerous Liaisons"). Quan's thesis is that Spitzer should have used word of mouth to find a prostitute--like most high-profile johns do--rather than going through an easily traceable Internet service. The "silly generalization about men who pay for sex," Quan writes, is that "they don't use their brains. But I encountered plenty of men who used their brains just fine." The problem with Eliot Spitzer, she argues, is that he "doesn't seem to be one of them."
The thread running through these uncritical discussions of prostitution is their focus on the circumstances of Spitzer's behavior. Each analysis seems to respond to the questions "How badly did he act? How much should we condemn him?" The articles use Spitzer's celebrity to frame their analysis, treating his behavior like a dumb mistake rather than a particularly powerful example of a ubiquitous crime. Though few agree with Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz that Spitzer committed a "victimless crime," the governor is portrayed more like a Hollywood star caught with cocaine than a public figure who fought for zero-tolerance solicitation laws and then
-mock Dupr√©: on the one hand, by exposing details about her interests, the articles resist the trope of the faceless, voiceless, victimized prostitute. On the other, Dupr√© is blatantly portrayed as a foolish twentysomething in over her head, and a hot one at that (hence the Times' display of suggestive pictures). Would Spitzer be more or less reprehensible if "Kristen" were someone else? Does it matter whether, as Dupr√©'s mother said in one interview, the prostitute can "handle someone like the governor"? Would it be worse if she were of a different race, class or age?
Dubner and Quan both imply that someone like the governor falls into a differentiated category of sex consumer; perhaps the situation would be different if the offender were not so rich and powerful. Elite prostitution and solicitation, the reporters suggest, is simply a different game with a different set of rules than average prostitution.
<strong>Bad distinctions</strong>
This is where the Times' sloppy discourse becomes damaging. The Spitzer scandal reinforces the worst ideas about prostitution in America. The Times sensationalizes Spitzer and Dupr√©, but under law the personal attributes of this john and prostitute shouldn't matter at all. Prostitution is not illegal in the United States because of vestigial Puritanism; it is illegal because it systematizes inhumane and abusive working conditions for disadvantaged women. Ashley Alexandra Dupr√© may not be a street prostitute, but she's still a prostitute, and separating her from the context of victimized sex workers distracts us from the serious problems that prostitution poses for most women. Why should Dupr√© be treated as a glamorous victim by the media--and why, for that matter, do call girls get to write op-eds--when other prostitutes are serving prison time for their actions?
The point is not that Dupr√© should be punished or, for that matter, that prostitutes should be criminalized no matter what. The ics blog, where bloggers contrast "high class" call girls with "hookers" and "street walkers," who are described as poor, uneducated, diseased, dishonest and ugly.
<strong>Rules aren't made to be broken</strong>
And what about Client 9? Surprisingly few journalists have focused on the biggest irony of the governor's fall: this June, Spitzer pushed progressive anti-trafficking legislation through the New York State Senate, calling human trafficking "modern day slavery and among the most repugnant crimes." The legislation deliberately treats trafficked persons as victims and strengthens the punishment of traffickers and clients. Typically, johns are arrested for prostitution at a fraction of the rate that prostitutes are; New York, however, has increased its sentences for clients in recent years, experimenting with alternative punishments like "john schools" to deter men from repeat offending. The idea behind anti-trafficking and anti-solicitation laws is that men implicitly exploit women when they engage in prostitution, regardless of individual men's private motivations or desires. Johns are always implicated in a larger system of abuse, and the stakes are too high to be particular about punishment.
Eliot Spitzer understood this principle-- he sought zero-tolerance punishment for the demand side of prostitution. Clearly, Spitzer's celebrity should not make his exploitative behavior more tolerable than any other client's. Spitzer violated more than just New York law--he violated the principle of non-differentiation that justifies the law in the first place. Far from committing a victimless crime, Spitzer hurt those who are victims of prostitution, who need anti-solicitation law to be enforced without exception. This scandal is not about one man and one woman having consensual sex; it's about the New York governor allying himself with a widely abusive sex market.
Like Spitzer, The New York Times is in a position of power. Its messages have augmented social meaning, just like the governor's decisions do. It would be wise for the Times not to fall prey to the same immature mistake as Spitzer: treating prostitution as personal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rich people don't eat Wonder Bread. They also avoid white eggs (brown are more natural) and tap water (tastier if from Fiji) and, during the hot summer months, drink Newman's Own Limeade instead of red-flavored Kool-Aid. Hundreds of years from now, archaeologists will infer that College Hill was one of Providence's wealthiest neighborhoods simply from the trashed vegan products left in a derelict Eastside Marketplace or the cans of organic mango pulp lining the ruined aisles of Whole Foods. They'll find a living mold blanketing what was once Farmstead Creamery, perhaps also a bottle or two of Domaine le Clos de Caveau.

<!--more-->
Globalization unifies markets, but at the cost of dividing people into rich and poor based on how they feed themselves. The rich are increasingly turning to foods made lovingly on a small scale to recover the taste of real food, forgotten after more than a century of cornflakes, margarine and Kraft cheese singles. A romantic vision of the pastoral life is imagined, later remembered. Laws are enacted to protect agricultural heritage from foreign imitators, turning wine from Champagne and Kobe Beef into luxury brands.
At the periphery of the market, in places yet untouched by the Internet, the pastoral lives of billions are at risk as agricultural conglomerates muscle their way into villages that have been supplied with local produce for thousands of years. Enormous farms in the heartlands owned by even larger corporations decamp to foreign nations where the soil is richer and the labor cheaper. A massive switch between local and industrial methods of agriculture is taking place between the developed and the third world. The former wants realer food, the latter simply wants more. As markets adjust to feed these desires, the consumer has been blitzed on both ends by big agribusiness and the organic food movement.
<strong>The family farm is dead</strong>
The battle for the appetites of the six billion stomachs worldwide has already been won by big agribusiness. The American family farm is on life support: according to the US Department of Agriculture, only two percent of American farms are family-owned. Technology and economies of scale have rendered the traditional farm obsolete in spite of all the songs Willie Nelson sings at Farm-Aid concerts. Proponents of traditional farming believe that we have forgotten the taste of freshly grown food after years of buying processed food off supermarket shelves. And it is true that the blocks of mozzarella found at Stop & Shop are totally alien to the buttery, fresh buffalo-milk cheese invented in Italy during the Middle Ages. Does the death of the family farm mean the end of good food?
Proponents of industrial agriculture point out that quality versus quantity is a false dichotomy: they often go hand in hand. Coca-Cola and Cool Ranch Doritos are damn tasty and easy to produce. And you'd be hard pressed to make them at home. Homemade butter may be tastier than Land O'Lakes, but try convincing mom to churn a vat of whole milk each day. Farm fresh eggs are the best, but shipping eggs everyday from the farm to the market would burn millions of dollars in gasoline--millions that would eventually hit the buyer's pocketbook. In any case, grocery store prices usually amount to little more than the caprice of the consumer: 50 years ago, refined white bread was more expensive than brown bread. Buyers like to flash their cash by showing how health-conscious they are, and this is the only thing that can prevent the family farm from dissolving into the forgotten mists of Americana along with the American bison and the Lindy Hop.
<strong>Long live the family farm </strong>
By peddling authenticity, chains like Whole Foods, Wild Oats and Trader Joe's (aimed at the upper middle class) and small independent stores like Farmstead Creamery (aimed at the upper upper middle class) have profited immensely from the organic foods movement. For the last few years, the organic food market has grown by leaps and bounds, averaging between 17 and 20 percent, while the conventional food market has grown by a relatively anemic two to three percent. Advertising has taken its toll: most people now believe that organic farmers provide better food that is better for the environment and are willing to pay premium prices to partake.
With the money pouring into the organic foods market, big agribusiness will not be able to stay away for long, but the image of the small, independent farm making wholesome food without antibiotics or chemical pesticides for sale in local markets has been set in the minds of consumers. Even if the situation is changing, the movement to save family farms is entangled with a burgeoning sense of responsibility toward the environment and public health.
Organic food is probably tastier than regular food; it has to justify its price somehow. And avoiding the use of antibiotics and chemical pesticides is obviously better for the health of both land and animals. However, that does not mean that organic food is better for the environment. The trade-off in production necessitated by making organic foods means that to make equivalent amounts of food, more land has to be used. By ultimately demanding more resources for the production of food for richer consumers, organic food temporarily assuages the conscience of the wealthy while it adds to the exorbitant environmental burden they place on everyone else.
<strong>Damned if you do</strong>
Factory farms are much more efficient than family farms. Yet the tradeoff is a classic Catch-22: despite the savings in land and cost, factory farming is a nasty business. The vast streams of shit produced by farm animals accumulate in lagoons of waste too large to be absorbed by the land. Property values collapse downwind: how can you sell your house when the smell of shit is ingrained in the furniture? The thousands of confined animals are injected with dozens of antibiotics to prevent disease from spreading bubonically one to the other; as long as the animal remains standing, it's legal to slaughter it. The litany of the evils is too long to recite; for more than a century, from The Jungle to Fast Food Nation, people have been aware of the toxic effects of factory farming on the environment and worker as the demand for food grows without bound.
There will be nine billion mouths to feed in 2050; billions who want meat, who crave the same beef and pork and chicken eaten by the rich and powerful. The global drive for food is insatiable as population increases exponentially, leading to a Malthusian disaster. These days, sushi is the new caviar as fish populations collapse and prices skyrocket, despite the ubiquitous heavy metal contamination found in almost all wild-caught seafood. Bluefish tuna, which grow to be more than six feet long and weigh more than 300 pounds each, cannot reproduce to keep up with the rapacious rate at which they are fished. This week, The New York Times reported a crash in fall-run Chinook salmon populations in California; the winter-run Chinook populations are already protected under the Endangered Species Act. Without newer, more efficient methods of farming, sustainable development is impossible: factory farming is here to stay.
<strong>
Damn the GMOs, full speed ahead</strong>
Globalized farming threatens both the livelihood of millions of subsistence farmers worldwide and the welfare of first world agriculture. The millions of peasants who currently enjoy local organic food farmed by their neighbors will soon be put out of business by larger industrial operations that produce more for less. The upshot is that the life of the peasant is far from the pastoral idyll imagined by proponents of family farming. In the last decade, more than 25,000 farmers in India have committed suicide to escape debtors after failed harvests.
One of the factors influencing the poverty of third world farmers is the disproportionately low prices created by first world subsidies that keep American and European farmers competitive. This same rationale has motivated the gross rejection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by European farmers, who see genetically modified seed as a convenient way for (usually American) plant biotechnology companies to hold farmers hostage to productive but sterile hybrid plants. Part of this same strategy of protecting European farmers from the vagaries of globalization is the branding of historically regional products, such as wines from Burgundy or cheese from Parma, to protect them from foreign substitutes. Even if sparkling wine made √† la m√©thode Champenoise in, say, Argentina is the best, regional branding keeps the historical cachet of the wine in its pays d'origine.
Poor nations and rich nations are in the middle of a strange switch: as the increased efficiency of factory farms displaces subsistence farmers in the developing world, smaller, quality-driven enterprises selling local organic food are growing rapidly in the first world. The shifts caused by global capital in how we eat are immense, but the divide between the rich and the poor remain the same. Ruben's ample nudes have been replaced by the "Skinny Bitch" glamorized by the eponymous best-seller. At least the modern poor will be able to enjoy the same benefits of high cholesterol and blood sugar as the rest of us: it's much better than having nothing at all.

		<title>NOT (UN)DEAD YET: COMMEMORATING THE RISE OF RHODE ISLAND&#039;S FAVORITE VAMPIRE By Victoria Chao Illustration by Perrin Ireland</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>"Dr. Metcalf cut open her chest and pulled out her heart. He sliced it open. Clotted and decomposed blood fell to the ground."</strong>
The smell of rotting flesh wafted across the cold grave markers of the Chestnut Hill Baptist Church cemetery in Exeter, Rhode Island. The men who entered the graveyard on the evening of March 17, 1892 had finally found the vampire responsible for a rash of deaths by consumption--now called Tuberculosis.

<!--more-->
In the four years leading up to that night, George T. Brown had already lost his wife Mary and two daughters, Mary Olive and Mercy Lena, to consumption. His remaining child, 24-year-old Edwin, would soon succumb to the same fate. Edwin's slow spiral toward death began with a hollow, persistent cough. Within weeks, his coughs began to produce sputum, a greenish-yellow mixture of mucus and saliva from the depths of his diseased lungs; soon after, they sprayed streaks of blood into his handkerchief. At first, the hemorrhaging could be measured in teaspoons; later, it could be measured in cups. As his body wasted away, his face became ruddy, then pale. By March of 1892, he had entered the final stages of the disease. A feverish flush came over his hollow cheeks. His lungs wheezed, and his ribs heaved as he gasped for each breath.
Although records indicate that George was not a superstitious man, his desperation to save Edwin opened him up to new explanations for his family tragedy. According to local legend, the vampire spirit spread the fatal illness by inhabiting dead bodies. It rose from the grave at night to suck the blood of the possessed body's living relatives, allowing it to sustain its corpse while passing the horrible disease on to the family. In order to save the victim's life and halt the vampire spirit, the possessed body had to be found and its heart cut out, cremated and consumed by the ill person. Scientists tried to convince the people of Exeter that consumption came from a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the people would not be swayed. Fancy science and microscopic organisms, after all, were no more tangible than supernatural beings.
<strong>The big dig</strong>
On March 17, 12 men entered the small graveyard adjacent to the Chestnut Hill Baptist Church. Dr. Howard Metcalf, the district medical examiner, accompanied them, though he discouraged the heart-removal operation, calling the vampire theory "absurd." Still, he stood by as the men dug up the three corpses of the Brown family. One by one, he opened their caskets. Mary Brown's rotten body still had some muscle fibers and flesh attached to her bones, but her heart contained no blood. In Mary Olive's coffin, nothing remained but her skeleton and a "thick growth of hair." Finally, the doctor lifted the lid on Mercy Brown's casket to reveal a well-preserved body that maintained its consumptive pallor with rosy cheeks. Dr. Metcalf cut open her chest and pulled out her heart. He sliced it open. Clotted and decomposed blood fell to the ground. The gravediggers immediately kindled a fire in the graveyard. They threw in the heart. It sizzled and burned to dust. They dissolved the ashes in medicine. Edwin gagged down the mucky mixture of liquid and cremated corpse and died exactly one and a half months later, on May 2, 1892.
After 116 years, we are still fascinated by the story of Mercy Brown. One man claimed to have seen a ball of blue light hover above the Brown family plot when he was a teenager. Another man claims that making a rubbing of Mercy's gravestone will reveal a "very evil face" in the bottom right corner that isn't visible on the actual stone. After reading these accounts, I had to see the grave for myself.
<strong>Don't stop me now
</strong>
The round-topped gravestones that compose the Brown family plot huddle like cartoon ghosts around a scraggly cedar tree. They stand a short walk down the crunchy gravel path that winds through the Chestnut Hill Baptist Church cemetery. I am not the first to visit Mercy's grave in recent weeks. A series of half-full and shattered glasses litter the grass around her headstone. A pink velvet scrunchie rests on the dirt above her buried, decomposed head. A man in a green Jeep Wrangler, presumably the groundskeeper, sneers at me as he slowly drives down the path. Mercy Brown's gravestone was briefly stolen in 1996. I assume he wants to prevent a repeat incident.
Exceptfortheman'saccusingstare,myvisit is decidedly terror-free. But seeing the family of gravestones so close together with their short range of death dates makes me question my own attitude toward the vampire theory. In 1892, science had yet to produce a reliable cure for Tuberculosis. Back then, modern medicine was called the "germ theory"; it was not a universally accepted explanation of disease. Faced with the prospect of losing his entire family in four years, was it really so absurd for George to believe in vampires?
When my doctor gives me pills, I take them, no questions asked. I have no idea what actually happens when these mysterious chemicals enter my bloodstream, but I have faith that they will make me better. Maybe 116 years from now someone will uncover mybottlesofibuprofenandtubesofAirborne and wonder what on Earth I was thinking.

		<title>PAPA&#039;S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG: EVOLUTION/REVOLUTION AT RISD MUSEUM</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Evolution/Revolution, currently on view at the RISD museum, includes fake Chanel and Balenciaga bags of a different species than the Canal Street lovelies. Designer Mary Ping has created striking replicas of easily recognizable purses in natural cotton and linen as a sort of slogan for her line, Slow and Steady Wins the Race. But even as she jokes about conspicuous consumption in our culture, Mary Ping is no angry outsider. A respected designer of original as well as copycat pieces, she uses simple, accessible materials and keeps prices reasonable in an effort to bring democracy back to the tents Bryant Park. Mary Ping's work places her in a group of contemporary designers that attempt to refine the practices of a business they feel has become environmentally and socially wasteful--but not in a let's-throwred-paint kind of way. These artists attempt to contribute to the design industry on their own terms.

<!--more-->
Evolution/Revolution considers the efforts of apparel and textile designers in the context of the Arts and Crafts movement centered in Britain in the late 19th century. The movement was an effort to re-instill meaning and beauty in functional objects by returning to handmade techniques in the age of mass production. Artists such as William Morris, who made botanically inspired fabric and wallpaper using vegetable dyes, were concerned with the preservation of nature and traditional handicrafts. The juxtaposition of Morris pieces such as Borage (1883) and Larkspur (1875) with contemporary fashion confronts the viewer with the similarities between the reformers of the Arts and Crafts movements and those of today.
The artists emphasize the importance of environmentally responsible production throughout the show. Christien Meindertsma attaches photos and information regarding the sheep whose wool she used to create each of the sweaters in her 2005 Dyckman Farmhouse Collection. The playfully tacky prize ribbons affixed to each piece avoid morbidity; Meindertsma simply wishes to foster a transparent process that encourages a greater appreciation for the source.
Similarly, Andrea Zittel of A-Z Smockshop foregrounds process with blatant seams that expose the construction of her pieces. A-Z employs practicing artists whose work does not yet generate income, and encourages clients to wear their smock every day of its season of purchase in an attempt to refine the consumer's role.
Meanwhile, RISD graduate Alyce Santoro considers recycling by using unraveled cassette tapes to create what she calls "sonic fabric" for Silent (dress) (2007) and Tell-Tail Thangkas (2004). Her work strives for more than sustainability; waving a tape head over the material actually generates sound. A patch of velvet on Silent (dress) and saucy orange circles on Tell-Tail Thangkas attempt to translate auditory contrasts into visual ones, bridging the gap between sensations.
Perhaps the most exciting piece in the exhibit is one of Carla Fernandez's two wool "waist-loom-woven, hand-felted" outfits, entitled Woman's Ensemble (Chamula blouse and skirt) (2008). The thick, hair-like texture of its black elements is the result of a two-month long process involving mud soaking by the women of an indigenous co-op in Chiapas, Mexico. The irony of the severe square open back and short, flouncy skirt in such an over-the-top texture is not lost in its conscious mode of production.
The exhibit is a clear endorsement of a natural, visible process that humanizes the production and consumption of functional goods. This agenda is as readily apparent as the ways of making the works; the show values instruction as much as inspiration. The highlights are the points when the conscious process does not preclude the aesthetic value of a piece.
Evolution/Revolution will be at the RISD museum until June 15.

		<title>WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME: SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY AT THE ROCK By Molly Young Illustration by Mateo Mancia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sunday morning I eat breakfast at Meeting Street with a friend who is visiting from out of town. On the way back to the train station I accidentally pepper-spray him in the face. His eyes become glowing rubies and his voice grows hoarse. "I sucked it in," he coughs, pointing to his throat. A man nearby is hanging out on his porch and observes the whole thing. He leans over the railing with a casual smile like it is nothing unusual, and recommends "cold water for that shit." We thank him for his advice.

<!--more-->
At 1:00 PM I go to the Rock. A kid is puking outside. "Sorry," he says as I hop over his vom on my way in. It is fuchsia-colored. I have seen this kid around campus before; I always thought he personified the word "hangdog," and never more so than right now. It is nice of him to apologize.
Things are worse in the lobby. The regular coffee is out; only hazelnut and decaf are available. What is the point? A sign taped to the bagel case at the snack cart reads:
There is NO cream cheese today
But I do not want a dry and untoasted bagel. I might as well crumple up a BDH and shove it down my throat.
For the first time ever, when I swipe my card, I notice that a little screen on the swiper flashes the words ACCESS GRANTED. The Rock is busy and I want to be alone with my unrewarding thoughts, so I find a carrel in the basement and colonize it. It is difficult to work because I keep hallucinating the smell of barf and begin to wonder if some of it has gotten on my shoe. Someone has scratched PIMP '94 on the desk and drawn three anuses on the wall.
After a few minutes of idling, two boys water bottles. Murmuring and nudging each other like farm animals. There is even a goaty smell in the air--oh. The boy next to me is eating feta cheese straight from the carton. There are white flakes drifting lightly onto his dreadlocks. Snowstorm.
Brown is an excellent school and yet everyone here looks as though he has just done tons of stupid things. Some people are sublimating their regrets into disciplined essay-writing and problem set-solving. Others are sitting blank and slack-jawed, doing nothing but allowing the library atmosphere to cleanse them of sin. There is a reason we all go to the Rock on Sunday. It is a psychic purgative. At least one person has taken this metaphor to its furthest extent by leaning over the balcony and ridding himself of partially digested mistakes. I should have asked him if he wanted some water or something. A napkin? Absolution?

		<title>BEAUTIFUL WASTELAND, IDOLIZED JUNKYARD: URBAN EXPLORATION IN PROVIDENCE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The door of the abandoned What Cheer Laundry Service building is covered with three posters. One is for a Rod Stewart tour you would think was an ironic imitation had you never seen the pre-digital graphics in his video for "Some Guys Get All the Luck." Another is an advertisement for a company that solves the problems of the overweight, uncomfortable and lonely. The third states plainly, "La Sangre de Cristo Nos Limpia de Todo": the blood of Christ cleans us of everything.

<!--more-->
The building stands next to a drive through ATM. Most of the clientele are too concerned with their finances to notice, but anyone who hopped the fence to take a look into What Cheer would get a few perplexed looks from soccer moms and sinister men in Oldsmobiles. Regardless, he wouldn't have much trouble getting in. In the corner of the thick, rotten wood door, there's a hole just big enough for a spindly, curious kid, and a backpack full of spray paint--an enthusiast of an activity known as urban exploration.
The dry cleaning factory on Cranston Street is one of many abandoned warehouses on the west side of Providence where the homeless sleep, graffiti artists rehearse and young people marvel at a history that seems out of reach. Stepping inside an abandoned factory can connect an explorer to the buildings that surround him and the routines that have defined them. For many, this connection with the past engenders a sense of the fragility of the present. The disregard for private property that surrounds much of the culture of urban exploration is often fueled by the realization that once an owner neglects his property, a space ceases to belong to anyone. After developing a relationship with a site that has been renounced by developers who promised a revitalized neighborhood, it can be difficult to watch it torn down to make way for a new development guaranteed to follow the same path.
<strong>Definitions</strong>
There is an incredibly wide range of ethics, practices and interests surrounding urban exploration. The most widespread belief espoused in the world of Internet communities portrays urban exploration as a way to reclaim formerly private space as public. People rummage through buildings, draw pictures on the walls and temporarily occupy uninhabited areas in order to turn them into beautiful, appreciated spaces reflecting local histories and contemporary experiences. By reclaiming spaces and using them for art displays and events, explorers turn forgotten spaces into venues for self and community expression. Some RISD students made a show of this idea in the early '90s when they organized a celebration of the pagan holiday Beltain-May Day in an abandoned tunnel near the Gano Street drawbridge: they crowded around a bonfire, chanting and wearing paper-mache animal masks. Despite getting into a skirmish with the police, by holding the event in the tunnel, they revitalized an otherwise lifeless piece of public property.
For some, exploring restricted spaces in urban locations is understood as sport. It even has its own acronym, UE, and a slew of slang names: urbex, vadding and hacking, to name a few. There are websites providing a range of information on the topic, from moralizing manifestos to tips on how to make your way through various obstacles to information about places of interest. But the object of the game is harder to pin down than in most sports. UE's competitiveness usually takes the form of a scavenger hunt involving tasks and acquisition; whoever can leave a tag at the highest point on the Gano Street drawbridge, for example, or take a souvenir from the tunnel system under Brown, wins.
Urban exploration is sometimes a kind of cowboyism, taking pains to explore and utilize the places hidden from the civilized. It's no coincidence that MIT students in the '70s borrowed two terms which referred to exploring computer systems, vadding and hacking, to describe their physical hobby of exploring their campus and city. The term vadding originated from a computer game popular on campus, named ADVENT, in which players navigate their way through a system of virtual tunnels. Hacking, on the other hand, came from the now commonplace enterprise of infiltrating computer systems and altering their sources in order to access features previously unavailable to general users. For many, abandoned buildings, much like the unexplored crevices of computer networking systems, are seen as a new frontier--the waste left over by overconfidence in American industry, soon to be re-colonized by corporations--that should be investigated, appreciated and rescued.
A project by the Providence art collective Trummerkind, for which artists built and lived in an apartment in an unused corridor of the Providence Place mall for nearly four years, offers an example. At a presentation they gave at Brown in December, they described how their project was guided by their "need to efficiently utilize unused space," re-appropriating the language of the developers who converted the previously mixed-use land into a space that's only public as long as the public is there to shop. While Michael Townsend, the spokesman of the collective, has avoided making any explicitly political statements about the project, it certainly raises questions about the mall developers' appropriation of mixed-use space.
But for all the anti-gentrification and anti-commercial values of most explorers, the celebration of decaying buildings has a number of complicated implications. Many people in the communities housing these buildings view them as blemishes on their neighborhoods. While most would not prefer to be pushed out by a new development in their place, they'd rather have the buildings go. For example, despite housing some of the best graffiti in the Providence area, the Shooters Nightclub near India Point Park is considered by many a blight that should be either sold or converted into a friendlier public space.
Going to abandoned sites can make one feel some discomfort for the role that middle class urban youth, particularly college students, play in displacing native residents by encouraging unregulated development. Coming across the private spaces of others is even more jarring to explorers and can alert them to the fact that their exploration can be a lot like slumming, only without exoticizing anybody. However, after a few visits, it eventually becomes possible to conceive of--if not understand--what it's like for someone who has to live there. Some knowledge of local homeless havens, or really any local geography away from College Hill, can be eye-opening.
<strong>
A new non-alignment movement</strong>
For every view on the ethics of urban exploration, there's a blog or zine somewhere offering it support. Some sites will include sections about their personal morals, while others attempt to stay away from ethical debates and stick to stories, photographs and lists of abandoned locations. It is true that these websites are, by the very fact that they encourage illegal activities, full of ethical statements. However, a crucial aspect of the online communities is that these debates, for the most part, take very little prominence; it is very easy for a viewer to navigate around them and find the information he is seeking. Like the activity itself, the largest purpose these communities serve has been to help people realize new uses for the space around them. The meaning of the activity has largely remained a personal undertaking.
<strong>Decay, preservation, development, decay</strong>
Global competition for factory jobs has left Providence as a utopia for industrial grave-robbers and explorers, but the city's plans for growth and gentrification are quickly building over urban decay. Abandoned property sat idly while Providence's notoriously corrupt mayor, Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, was busy outdoing Don Imus on his radio talk show and assaulting a man with a lit cigarette, an ashtray and a fireplace log. Since the election of Mayor David Cicilline, however, there have been efforts to clean up Providence by tearing down, or converting abandoned buildings in and around the city into luxury condos and state sponsored affordable housing. Most of the warehouses in Olneyville were abandoned until 10 or 15 years ago, when young artists started renting floors in factories for studios and living spaces. Business have been opening in warehouses as well, and will probably end up pushing the artists farther into the frontier of the poverty line, trailing them at every corner.
While Providence continues to be a great city for abandoned sites, deserted places will continue to disappear until the city's next period of rejuvenating destruction. However, such transformations are not boundaries to exploration. On the contrary, a static city is more of a hindrance; really, the whole point of crawling around in places some people don't want you to go is to find new paths through a constantly changing landscape.
