Dear future Indy web editor,

My name is Charlie and I used to have your job. Email me at 
charliexwindolf@gmail.com if you have any questions or whatever.

This site is kind of a shitshow. It was made by an old Indy web
editor who I guess wanted to try building a blog with Ruby on
Rails for his own edification. It worked, but it's kind of tough
to figure out if you haven't seen Rails before. Ask me whatever.

<3,
Charlie
