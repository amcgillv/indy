lingering things:
	better link to PDF
	better list link
	did Disqus comment counts work? is Disqus still on this thing?
	does the list load from indy, not indy-dev?
	how tf does one get the same goddam number of issues to show up per page

testing:
	articles with no section
	articles with no title (maybe validate on title?)
	check all the mobile pages for layout
